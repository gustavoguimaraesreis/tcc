  "question": "Have you ever wondered if it's possible to get hacked by clicking on a link? I'm sorry to say, but it's possible it is and I'll explain why.\n\nWell, every site has the javascript language in its code, for those who don't know, javascript is responsible for making the site more responsive and making your browser correspond with the site. Among them, a website may request access to your camera sometimes, without you realizing it, because most android devices, for example, the permission is already enabled. Permissions such as: location, camera and even microphone.\n\nAnother flaw is accessing links from sites that have the name \"Not secure\" next to a padlock. Usually sites that do not have the https protocol and SSL certificate. Sites like this are vulnerable to an attack called man in the middle, where a hacker can intercept everything that passes between the client and server connection.\n\nWe can't forget about Pharming, which is a type of Phishing where your attack difference is in DNS. Where it occurs we call \"DNS hijacking\". Example:\n\nLet's say you go to Facebook, and type: www.facebook.com. Instead of being redirected to the real facebook website, you will be redirected to a fake website where your data is stolen. All this just by attacking your DNS.\n\nGood studies!",

Though it's pretty obvious that some of this is bs (no Android OS I've ever seen has those permissions enabled by default, DNS hijacking is almost impossible with proper implementations of HSTS now), you're very much missing the point. If you follow even the most basic security practices (use antivirus, don't have JS enabled where you don't need to, don't share passwords between services, always ensure you're on HTTPS, enable full disk encryption, don't expose fucking SMB to insecure networks for the love of god), you're going to be basically impervious to 99.9% of everyday hackers. If you're interested in doing more than that, your threat model is most likely going to be more advanced.\n\nMany people lately have begun worrying about supply chain attacks with the recent issues involving say QNAP or Wordpress. Some people worry about their governments, which you can assume has access to the resources to crack TLS. Define your threat model. If you're willing to do that, you'll have a much easier time securing what you see as important. If you're not willing to do that, you can damn well assume that any part of your life that has ever touched the internet is already compromised. Live more of your life offline. And get off these stupid forums.",

You don't get ripped after working out for a few days, you gatta stay on it daily for years.\n\nAnd after constant pushing and trying, you will eventually see results. It may not be exactly what you want, but that's why we take baby steps, small goals to help motivate and keep going, and keep trying. If you don't understand something, you may just need it explained another way, or you're missing a foundation that might help you understand the subject. If someone is hurting, you can't stop the pain if you don't know what's under the skin. That's very normal for people to learn different ways. And you have to kind of get things wrong to be right, because you don't really know what's right unless you know what's wrong. And why it's wrong.",

  "title": "I Want to Kill Someone. What Resources Can Help Me Understand Why I Shouldn't?",
  "question": "As title says. There's someone who has stated clearly, to my face, in my own home, that he has great desire to hurt me and my loved ones. He was extremely aggressive, and i have good reason to believe his threats are real. I don't feel confident i can get legal action on him because so far nothings been \"worth\" keeping him in jail long enough, no evidence, and his gf is family and wants him because shes that desperate, so i cant really get rid of him like that, and hes not \"just going away\" on his own. and I'm not waiting to be ambushed on the streets with my loved ones standing next to me.\n\nIdk what im looking for either really. Some book, video, or expression of philosophy of killing, why its wrong right now, and what i could do as an alternative. I could just google \"books about killing or why its wrong\" but i don't know if the books that will be offered could pertain to my situation well enough plus, i don't have a lot of time. I would like recommendations from anyone who might know a good resource, and I don't know anywhere that will let me discuss that openly and anonymously besides some random darknet site. i don't think i can see a therapist either, as they can report you if you have intent, and i'm not here to ruin my life, in fact i have no idea how to stop it from being ruined or threatened other than doing this as cleanly as possible.\n\ntldr: I want to kill someone. So please help me understand why I should not, either through media (books, video, podcast), or express why you wouldn't in my situation. I feel pressed and motivated. thank you.",

I'd like to think this is pretty occasional, this is the first time i've had someone so seriously targeting me, but fact is that is how the mind works, normalization.\n\nI'm ganna look into them right away. Thank you!\n\nI don't know if this is really about socializing and \"tolerating\", i like to think im very reasonable and tolerant despite the subject at hand. Since day one of moving in with him i said \"if you have any problems about me or something im doing, please let me know, because i cant get better if i dont know whats wrong\". I feel the issue is more so he's that one in a thousand who's taking things too far when it comes to messing around with my life, and I can't stand the idea of just waiting for this big dude to whack me upside the head when my back is turned. When do I finally stop tolerating? How far is far enough?\n\nIve already had to move from my house, because he was too dangerous to live with till we got him kicked out, and now I dont feel like i can even go back because he knows the location. God help me if he goes for my family. If they get hurt, i don't know how i'd forgive myself for giving up on my plans now. \n\nDo I risk baring all that, or risk a felony, and the thought of killing a man directly impacting my life in several negative ways because of reasons because he hates me and doesnt want to make things work out? I lean towards the latter still. I do really hope there's something in these books that might help me settle this for me.",

I touched a bit on that with skyfolks answers. There's no official records we have had any contact. And the way my town is, and the way he is, if I made him \"just disappear\" it'd be a lot more suspected he just walked out or something. He has no one besides his gf hes connected to and they fight every single night dude. He's ruined all of his connections, i'm actually a pretty surprising suspect when you look at the line up. Plus, definitley no official police record with him. I got a lot planned out, and as long as i play my angles, im not going to get caught. And i dont know where i said i told my family about kiling him, but just 2 friends, and they arent going to be questioned because im not leaving the scene to look like he was even murdered. Just left. People leave randomly all the time, go missing, and he likes traveling. He's not someone they will look into, especially like this. The police are ganna ask his gf when their last fight was, shes ganna say the previous day then theyll give her the \"Well, we'll look into him\" with no real leads. Especially me. So pressure is just on me to make sure i really cover my trail, and not get caught.\n\nIs not thinking about it really an option? Isn't that what most of the world does with everything, and everything just gets worse? From the homeless problems to pollution, and several other problems literally destroying our planet?. I really believe this dude is a threat and a problem for us, and not thinking about it has not made him go away yet. \n\nI've had a lot of positive thoughts when they moved several states away. I have evidence he did. But then they came back to my specific town, a few miles down the road. What if he does hurt me or my family? I really don't know what positive thoughts i'll be able to think then. What if he kills me? I don't think anything will matter after that... These are thoughts that I don't feel logically make sense to ignore, when he has hurt people before, he's an agressive and explosive person with a possibly very warped sense of reality, and has definite intent on hurting me. Why do you think nothing bad will come from ignoring this?",

Isn't that what most of the world does with everything, and everything just gets worse? From the homeless problems to pollution, and several other problems literally destroying our planet?. I really believe this dude is a threat and a problem for us, and not thinking about it has not made him go away yet. \n\nI've had a lot of positive thoughts when they moved several states away. I have evidence he did. But then they came back to my specific town, a few miles down the road. What if he does hurt me or my family? I really don't know what positive thoughts i'll be able to think then. What if he kills me? I don't think anything will matter after that... These are thoughts that I don't feel logically make sense to ignore, when he has hurt people before, he's an agressive and explosive person with a possibly very warped sense of reality, and has definite intent on hurting me. Why do you think nothing bad will come from ignoring this?",

Thank you!\n\nI don't know if this is really about socializing and \"tolerating\", i like to think im very reasonable and tolerant despite the subject at hand. Since day one of moving in with him i said \"if you have any problems about me or something im doing, please let me know, because i cant get better if i dont know whats wrong\". I feel the issue is more so he's that one in a thousand who's taking things too far when it comes to messing around with my life, and I can't stand the idea of just waiting for this big dude to whack me upside the head when my back is turned. When do I finally stop tolerating? How far is far enough?\n\nIve already had to move from my house, because he was too dangerous to live with till we got him kicked out, and now I dont feel like i can even go back because he knows the location. God help me if he goes for my family. If they get hurt, i don't know how i'd forgive myself for giving up on my plans now. \n\nDo I risk baring all that, or risk a felony, and the thought of killing a man directly impacting my life in several negative ways because of reasons because he hates me and doesnt want to make things work out?

I touched a bit on that with skyfolks answers. There's no official records we have had any contact. And the way my town is, and the way he is, if I made him \"just disappear\" it'd be a lot more suspected he just walked out or something. He has no one besides his gf hes connected to and they fight every single night dude. He's ruined all of his connections, i'm actually a pretty surprising suspect when you look at the line up. Plus, definitley no official police record with him. I got a lot planned out, and as long as i play my angles, im not going to get caught. And i dont know where i said i told my family about kiling him, but just 2 friends, and they arent going to be questioned because im not leaving the scene to look like he was even murdered. Just left. People leave randomly all the time, go missing, and he likes traveling. He's not someone they will look into, especially like this. The police are ganna ask his gf when their last fight was, shes ganna say the previous day then theyll give her the \"Well, we'll look into him\" with no real leads. Especially me.

      "comment": "Actually, i didn't report him. i was just saying i dont know what the police would do even if i did. i was actually encouraged not to report anything because of my family. I touched a bit on that with skyfolks answers. There's no official records we have had any contact. And the way my town is, and the way he is, if I made him \"just disappear\" it'd be a lot more suspected he just walked out or something. He has no one besides his gf hes connected to and they fight every single night dude. He's ruined all of his connections, i'm actually a pretty surprising suspect when you look at the line up. Plus, definitley no official police record with him. I got a lot planned out, and as long as i play my angles, im not going to get caught. And i dont know where i said i told my family about kiling him, but just 2 friends, and they arent going to be questioned because im not leaving the scene to look like he was even murdered. Just left. People leave randomly all the time, go missing, and he likes traveling. He's not someone they will look into, especially like this. The police are ganna ask his gf when their last fight was, shes ganna say the previous day then theyll give her the \"Well, we'll look into him\" with no real leads. Especially me. So pressure is just on me to make sure i really cover my trail, and not get caught.\n\nIs not thinking about it really an option? Isn't that what most of the world does with everything, and everything just gets worse? From the homeless problems to pollution, and several other problems literally destroying our planet?. I really believe this dude is a threat and a problem for us, and not thinking about it has not made him go away yet. \n\nI've had a lot of positive thoughts when they moved several states away. I have evidence he did. But then they came back to my specific town, a few miles down the road. What if he does hurt me or my family? I really don't know what positive thoughts i'll be able to think then. What if he kills me? I don't think anything will matter after that... These are thoughts that I don't feel logically make sense to ignore, when he has hurt people before, he's an agressive and explosive person with a possibly very warped sense of reality, and has definite intent on hurting me. Why do you think nothing bad will come from ignoring this?",

      "comment": "how my family reacted is its own issue... they really did not do anything and encouraged me not to either. i called them immiedietley, thinking the same thing as you, i did not know if i should of even called the police that night because i was scared it would not do anything or make it worse, then that would probably trigger his bitch ass. family acted like they have never have had their lives directly threatened before, they said even i should not contact the police or make a big deal over it because the aggressor and his gf were leaving soon for another state, and we all thought they would leave itd blow over. it didnt. they came back, probably kicked out of the new place, and immediately started cussing out and back in town harassing my parents... and now we're just blocking numbers and looking over our shoulders while these people harbor some kind of unbridled rage for us for a LOT of reasons that we have no control over. we would help if we could. we were literally letting them live with me rent free for months before this incident. never had a problem. then one day, boom, cussing me out, threatning me less than an inch from my face in the house i grew up in. i always tried talking to them, i always want to change to be a better person to the people around me, but despite all that communication, he wants to stomp my brains out. ive never been aggressive or even passive aggressive to them, i HAD whatever respect i could lift, but this is messed up.\n\nmy friends are stunned by how my family acted. my friends are also on the \"do nott kill but don't know what the fuck you do\" fence too, so they are a neutral partty in this situation. and i get it. what do you even do here...\n\nthat's why i'm seeking something, some kind of real answer. id love this dude to have an epiphony and realize the error of his ways and had a christmas special or something. id get over this in minutes if that happened, i get being as angry at the world as him, but his life is not mine to fix like that. especially when he literally wants to put mine and loved ones in danger. and the way the law system works, my only option is to essentially prepare for an ambush when i'm out and about and probably when i'm offguard. i'm not here to be paranoid everytime i wanna enjoy a night out with a date. i'm not waiting for us to be victims. i cant do that. i'm doing a lot to be prepared for my night, so its quick and clean, i wont be caught, and i make it look like he just walked off one night, like the wonderer he is... he loves taking pride in that... he takes pride in alot of stuff despite doing nothing with his life but yell at his gf and threaten people... he takes pride in all that too, again, hes a REAL asshole and its clear the pride is connected to a lot of it. ive heard him abuse his animals too.\n\nSo please, im mostly resolved in my path and confident in my plan, but if theres a real alternative option im not seeing or understanding, i want to. i got killing, i got waiting to possibly be killed. i just want maybe one or two others. Thank you for taking the time to listen to me by the way.",

But with that said, if him threatening me lead to me doing this, what do you think a bat shit insane mofo is going to do if you threaten him? He's not going to justt walk away, stay away and cowar. Maybe he would, but if thats the way it works, then why am I waiting outside of his frequent shops after his threats?\n\nReality is where youre at. I want to live here. I have things to live for. He wants to damage that. He has had my worst interests in mind, and seeks to harm me. I would be incredibly happy if he just found peace, lived his dreams, and never harmed anyone ever again... As long as i know he will stop fucking with me. \n\nSo short answer to your question, yes. I don't know why everyone has the assumption I will be caught. You guys know how many people go missing a day right? Police don't even look for you after like three days... But besides that, if my only other consequence is the guilt from killing him.... Well I guess I'll just have to take in strides, day by day... anyways, back to stalking!",

      "comment": "He threatened me in my own house, and that made me feel certain things. I'm pretty rational despite the topic of this post. But with that said, if him threatening me lead to me doing this, what do you think a bat shit insane mofo is going to do if you threaten him? He's not going to justt walk away, stay away and cowar. Maybe he would, but if thats the way it works, then why am I waiting outside of his frequent shops after his threats?\n\nReality is where youre at. I want to live here. I have things to live for. He wants to damage that. He has had my worst interests in mind, and seeks to harm me. I would be incredibly happy if he just found peace, lived his dreams, and never harmed anyone ever again... As long as i know he will stop fucking with me. \n\nSo short answer to your question, yes. I don't know why everyone has the assumption I will be caught. You guys know how many people go missing a day right? Police don't even look for you after like three days... But besides that, if my only other consequence is the guilt from killing him.... Well I guess I'll just have to take in strides, day by day... anyways, back to stalking!",

I touched a bit on that with skyfolks answers. There's no official records we have had any contact. And the way my town is, and the way he is, if I made him \"just disappear\" it'd be a lot more suspected he just walked out or something. He has no one besides his gf hes connected to and they fight every single night dude. He's ruined all of his connections, i'm actually a pretty surprising suspect when you look at the line up. Plus, definitley no official police record with him. I got a lot planned out, and as long as i play my angles, im not going to get caught. And i dont know where i said i told my family about kiling him, but just 2 friends, and they arent going to be questioned because im not leaving the scene to look like he was even murdered. Just left. People leave randomly all the time, go missing, and he likes traveling. He's not someone they will look into, especially like this. The police are ganna ask his gf when their last fight was, shes ganna say the previous day then theyll give her the \"Well, we'll look into him\" with no real leads. Especially me. So pressure is just on me to make sure i really cover my trail, and not get caught.\n\nIs not thinking about it really an option? Isn't that what most of the world does with everything, and everything just gets worse? From the homeless problems to pollution, and several other problems literally destroying our planet?. I really believe this dude is a threat and a problem for us, and not thinking about it has not made him go away yet. \n\nI've had a lot of positive thoughts when they moved several states away. I have evidence he did. But then they came back to my specific town, a few miles down the road. What if he does hurt me or my family? I really don't know what positive thoughts i'll be able to think then. What if he kills me? I don't think anything will matter after that... These are thoughts that I don't feel logically make sense to ignore, when he has hurt people before, he's an agressive and explosive person with a possibly very warped sense of reality, and has definite intent on hurting me. Why do you think nothing bad will come from ignoring this?",

Depending on your situation, you can and should seek protection with the justice system if this person threatens you again. It sounds like this person is dependent on scaring you when others are not around, so it's your word against theirs. Take that advantage away and just record on your phone every time he might have a chance to be alone with you. That evidence is likely to be enough to file a police report and get a restraining order.",

I lean towards the latter still. I do really hope there's something in these books that might help me settle this for me.",

      "comment": "no i dont know i shouldnt right now, and thats why i want to know why its wrong. \n\nI dont know what more information i need to give. A man whos integrated in our family, has made clear and direct threats to my face, so close i could feel his spit sprayed on me, that he plans on harming me if he sees me again, and expressed his interest in harming other family members, especially the female ones... If thats not clear intent to harm someone i dont know what is. We live in the same area, his gf is a family member, its a small town, and hes hurt others. and im often out with loved ones he also has extreme aggression for. I dont want to be a victim while just walking down the streets bc some psycho chose me as his Target of the Day.\n\nive tried talking to him before shit hit the fan. i try to be open about any problems someone has about me, im willing to change. but hes... off. like if you asked me to get you some water and i responded \"GET IT YOURSELF, IM NOT YOUR SLAVE, HOW DARE YOU-\" that is the energy of the man. And thats something close to how the interaction happened. Not exactly, but the interaction that caused his explosion was VERY casual. And next thing i know hes screaming in my face and threatening me. He also makes direct comparisons to himself and jesus... and says other \"cult leader\" esk things just to express his mind and who he is a little more. hes not someone you \"just talk to\" otherwise we wouldnt be here bc ive tried.\n\nI dont know what police are supposed to do. Theres not enough evidence to prove anything, if he got locked up, hed probably out in a few months or year if im lucky, and then what? just hope he forgot? If you had a Uncle or some close but distant family member, they threatened the safety of you and your family, and know where you and your family live, and is explosive enough to randomly attack you on site if you saw eachother in public, and we have before the fight, we shop in common areas, what would you do?\n\nPlease let me know if theres some specific piece of information, that you need, and i did not convey. But I think I need to be a bit vague, not trying to leave anything too identifiable here, including a motive.",

If they get hurt, i don't know how i'd forgive myself for giving up on my plans now. \n\nDo I risk baring all that, or risk a felony, and the thought of killing a man directly impacting my life in several negative ways because of reasons because he hates me and doesnt want to make things work out? I lean towards the latter still. I do really hope there's something in these books that might help me settle this for me.",

If you read what i said to skyfolks, it's pretty extreme. And don't worry, i'll always take advice but I feel good on my method, i'm going to make him disappear nice and clean, and i've got all my motives, alibis, and angles covered. A cop wont even be able to get me once i start moving him.\n\nIll try to push through these books and let you know what I think. And it means a lot to me to have that option, thank you.",

      "comment": "no i dont know i shouldnt right now, and thats why i want to know why its wrong. \n\nI dont know what more information i need to give. A man whos integrated in our family, has made clear and direct threats to my face, so close i could feel his spit sprayed on me, that he plans on harming me if he sees me again, and expressed his interest in harming other family members, especially the female ones... If thats not clear intent to harm someone i dont know what is. We live in the same area, his gf is a family member, its a small town, and hes hurt others. and im often out with loved ones he also has extreme aggression for. I dont want to be a victim while just walking down the streets bc some psycho chose me as his Target of the Day.\n\nive tried talking to him before shit hit the fan. i try to be open about any problems someone has about me, im willing to change. but hes... off. like if you asked me to get you some water and i responded \"GET IT YOURSELF, IM NOT YOUR SLAVE, HOW DARE YOU-\" that is the energy of the man. And thats something close to how the interaction happened. Not exactly, but the interaction that caused his explosion was VERY casual. And next thing i know hes screaming in my face and threatening me. He also makes direct comparisons to himself and jesus... and says other \"cult leader\" esk things just to express his mind and who he is a little more. hes not someone you \"just talk to\" otherwise we wouldnt be here bc ive tried.\n\nI dont know what police are supposed to do. Theres not enough evidence to prove anything, if he got locked up, hed probably out in a few months or year if im lucky, and then what? just hope he forgot? If you had a Uncle or some close but distant family member, they threatened the safety of you and your family, and know where you and your family live, and is explosive enough to randomly attack you on site if you saw eachother in public, and we have before the fight, we shop in common areas, what would you do?\n\nPlease let me know if theres some specific piece of information, that you need, and i did not convey. But I think I need to be a bit vague, not trying to leave anything too identifiable here, including a motive.",

But with that said, if him threatening me lead to me doing this, what do you think a bat shit insane mofo is going to do if you threaten him? He's not going to justt walk away, stay away and cowar. Maybe he would, but if thats the way it works, then why am I waiting outside of his frequent shops after his threats?\n\nReality is where youre at. I want to live here. I have things to live for. He wants to damage that. He has had my worst interests in mind, and seeks to harm me. I would be incredibly happy if he just found peace, lived his dreams, and never harmed anyone ever again... As long as i know he will stop fucking with me. \n\nSo short answer to your question, yes. I don't know why everyone has the assumption I will be caught. You guys know how many people go missing a day right? Police don't even look for you after like three days... But besides that, if my only other consequence is the guilt from killing him.... Well I guess I'll just have to take in strides, day by day... anyways, back to stalking!",

      "comment": "Actually, i didn't report him. i was just saying i dont know what the police would do even if i did. i was actually encouraged not to report anything because of my family. I touched a bit on that with skyfolks answers. There's no official records we have had any contact. And the way my town is, and the way he is, if I made him \"just disappear\" it'd be a lot more suspected he just walked out or something. He has no one besides his gf hes connected to and they fight every single night dude. He's ruined all of his connections, i'm actually a pretty surprising suspect when you look at the line up. Plus, definitley no official police record with him. I got a lot planned out, and as long as i play my angles, im not going to get caught. And i dont know where i said i told my family about kiling him, but just 2 friends, and they arent going to be questioned because im not leaving the scene to look like he was even murdered. Just left. People leave randomly all the time, go missing, and he likes traveling. He's not someone they will look into, especially like this. The police are ganna ask his gf when their last fight was, shes ganna say the previous day then theyll give her the \"Well, we'll look into him\" with no real leads. Especially me. So pressure is just on me to make sure i really cover my trail, and not get caught.\n\nIs not thinking about it really an option? Isn't that what most of the world does with everything, and everything just gets worse? From the homeless problems to pollution, and several other problems literally destroying our planet?. I really believe this dude is a threat and a problem for us, and not thinking about it has not made him go away yet. \n\nI've had a lot of positive thoughts when they moved several states away. I have evidence he did. But then they came back to my specific town, a few miles down the road. What if he does hurt me or my family? I really don't know what positive thoughts i'll be able to think then. What if he kills me? I don't think anything will matter after that... These are thoughts that I don't feel logically make sense to ignore, when he has hurt people before, he's an agressive and explosive person with a possibly very warped sense of reality, and has definite intent on hurting me. Why do you think nothing bad will come from ignoring this?",

Then make the incoming dirty money fit with the company's balance sheets but always gradually. Example if I have a Thai food delivery place with a clean monthly income of 5K and I have undeclared / murky income I will add them as sales safely without raising suspicions.\n For success of this, order and not rushing is key. it will always be easier to launder physical assets than digital ones, but the NFT industry also allows efficient laundering if all situations are met.\n\nThis is explained in a very summarized way, to put it into practice is a little more complex since it requires logistics and having liquidity from before. The Treasury knows these techniques but if it does not raise any suspicion and complies with the payment of taxes nothing should happen.",

So kind of like the coding environment and terminal of another computer, but being able to access it remotely.\n\nA remote computer can be accessed with ssh from the host computer, but that involves going physically to the other computer and configuring everything .\n\nMy idea is this: a web service with p2p that allows a user to access another computer and storing files without actually downloading things. Bitorrent relies on downloading, which would be a problem since my computer can't handle storage.\n\nThe other part of my idea is a p2p server that allows people to store files and code on it without putting pressure on their own device.\n\nI'm not really sure how to explain this good. Maybe some info that can help me understand this better.",

    "answerContent": "There is definitely a platform that could do this, I've done exactly this with Proxmox. Proxmox is a virtualization platform designed to be administered entirely through a web browser without downloading any extra software. While SPICE could make your remote desktop connection a little faster, the NoVNC works just fine in the browser.\n\n(I don't have the code anymore, just poking your brain so you can get an idea of how this could work) A couple years ago, I used to work at a Iowa State University helping fellow Software Engineering students. I had my Proxmox server back at my dorm. For some students in my class, they didn't have laptops powerful enough to run some of the IDEs we liked, so they remoted into the university servers. To make things a little easier on them, I wrote my own solution in PHP (I know, shut up, I wasn't good at JS back then): a wrapper script for the Proxmox API. Upon visiting the page, it would trigger a call to Proxmox which cloned a KVM from Debian template, pulled the necessary info, then redirected the student to the NoVNC session. Upon closing the NoVNC console, a cron job running every few minutes would kill/deallocate the VM. So whenever students wanted to do something real quick, from any device, they could pull up a fully functioning, software-loaded, and clean development environment, do whatever they wanted for however long they wanted, then left.\n\nIf you don't want to script this, the Proxmox web interface is still pretty intuitive and supports a full user permission system. You can do it all by hand pretty easily. Plus it's free and whatnot, so that's cool. Just gotta get the server set up on hardware that can run however many VMs you plan on running",

Police and authorities absolutely do not tolerate it. I know of two minors, one male one female who got caught, both of them got 'conditional conviction' (a thing in Russia similar to parole where you make one more misstep and you go to prison).\n\nTo answer your question, on their own accounts both of them were searched upon arrest by officers of the same sex in presence of two witnesses of the same sex. They were requested to surrender all belongings, undress completely, remove all underwear, everything. Their bodies and body cavities were examined, all their clothes and belongings were examined and swab tested. The girl was 14.\n\nI've heard that in Western and Central Europe the police is very liberal to these kinds of occurences and it is unlikely there will be arrest or search of this kind. Can't say about the rest of the world.",

    "answerContent": "Yes, you are following a bad path here.\n\nTheir power and influence doesn't happened in the last quarter of century. They are around since the time Egypt was ruled by Pharaos working their way toward the top of the society.\n\nOnce you are the top, you will work to stay at the top. That's why they work their influence the way they do. It is not their privilege: any group or society would very likely do the same.\n\nThe problem is how power is held and controlled, not the Jews. If somebody reaches the top, they will try to be replaced by somebody like them. Try to be successful in Japan being a gaijin (foreigner). You will hit a really hard wall.\n\nIt is what I call \"sense of community as unity\".\n\nSince, historically, nobody really enjoyed having Jews around, so they have developed a really strong sense of community between them, and will always try to privilege their own people. As well Asians, Latinos, Black, Indians and any other foreign community.\n\nIt is not unusual, it is just a matter of perspective.\n\nIt is hard to criticize any people because of that, independent if they are Jews, black, Latino or Asian, because you will sound racist. But very likely you would do the same if you were wearing their shoes. Just look around and you will find a lot of examples, even in smaller scales, like a manager who will privilege an intern that came from the same university or frat.\n\nThere will be a lot of effort from outsiders to take this power and put their agenda/interests/people at the spotlight, so you need to filter and try to think for yourself, because they will use the other group power and influence as a bad propaganda, but hey are just trying to do the same.",

Some of them target private hospitals.\n\nYou may find some there, for free. \n\nOtherwise, better know an IT guy from the hospital that you want records from. If you have deep pockets, go to LinkedIn, and ask if they are willing to sell you.\n\nIt won't take long for you to find someone willing to do, but I suspect that won't come cheap.",

  "title": "Old Hidden Answers database dump (partial)",
  "question": "So I'm new here, but I understand there was some drama with the old Hidden Answers shutting down and conflict among the admins/mods etc etc. I have no interest in that drama, but I do have something cool to share.\n\nLast year I was working on a project. I won't get into the details, and the project is archived now, but the cool part of this project involved indexing large chunks of the Tor network. Given that Hidden Answers is offline now, I pulled the my project archive back online and took a look around the old database, only to find that a good chunk of the Hidden Answers database was archived and nested within my own database. I wrote a small script to compile all the old URLs from the site, which includes the titles of about 27 thousand questions and some profiles.\n\nIt was fun to browse around the old database and see the questions people were asking. Perhaps it could be a project in the future for me to compile the old database into a functioning mirror site?\n\nUnfortunately HA doesn't allow me to attach files directly, so I've uploaded it to Backblaze for you to download. I likely won't host this file there indefinitely, especially if it starts getting abused: https://f000.backblazeb2.com/file/filesharedrop/hiddenAnswers-2020-urls-slimmed.txt",

I'm an active member of the US military, we've been over there monitoring the situation as it developed, and we're over there now. I'll wager, or at least I'll hope that we're going to get more involved.\n\nUkraine isn't in NATO, but it's the only thing sitting between Russia and a massive body of NATO countries. It serves as a strategic advantage for Russia to take Ukraine, but naturally it makes a lot of those NATO countries very nervous. The US has a legally binding responsibility to defend those countries, so we'd definitely be beefing up defenses around that area, even if we don't get involved directly.\n\nOverall I'm excited. I'm just as much against the military industrial complex as the next guy here in the states, but good god we need something to rally against. A strong and clear foreign conflict could be good for us. Obviously that's very self-centered, but I'm hoping that we can kick the shit out of some Russians while simultaneously boosting the overall moral of the US and by extension the world.",

I call and hangup like 20x just to fuck with them. When they block me, I either change the number or when I overchange it, I create another account.

This issue has emerged as particularly relevant to EU security despite stringent firearms control measures.\n\nOne possible path is through the 'dark web', which hosts many different online black markets that facilitate the sale of prohibited firearms, weapons, explosives and digital materials.\n\nWhile doing my research I found this dark web site (cez6tnx7scccm7j6wyvj3gm4cke55n2huoo4opxld7ams7wgnkbkpjid.onion) that sells guns, although I cannot independently verify its authenticity",

I did a ritual with all the propper steps to summon spirits to help me with something. I didn't really expect it to work, but it did and the spirits didn't feel right; they were of the devil. Idk how I know that, but they just felt off, not good, and almost malicious (kinda like more accurate genies, they'll technically grant your wish but screw you over in every other way). So after a long and hard process, I got rid of them and contacted some local religious authorities.\n\nWould not recommend summoning demons if you don't know exactly what you're doing (or just in general)",

  "question": "I have no Idea where to start, December 1-2020, My girlfriend left me for a guy and didn't even bothered to tell the reason behind it. Still I don't know. I changed my career and left my passion and hobbies just to take care of her and almost spent around 600 dollars per month just for the sake of her daily needs. Later I heard from one of my friends that she's been sleeping with a lot of dudes from her college when we were in a relationship. The day she left me is the same day I lost my dad. I couldn't even bring myself all together, Yet still I somehow managed to accept all of this and tried to bring back my life together. I started hitting the gym, had a healthy lifestyle and a clean work routine.\n\nLast month she texted me and asked me to take her back as her new boyfriend left her. Ever since she texted, I'm no longer focused of my goals and I'm always waiting for her text. I tried apply for 3 grad schools and got rejected from all of em and I also got fired from my job last week, even though it was my seniors mistake. I'm severely addicted to porn and I can't stop doing it. I try to work hard and keep myself positive all the time, Still I haven't been able to cross this rough path. I don't have any friends or family to advice me through this. I don't know what to do. I'm tired. I wanna go somewhere and never return. I just wanna be happy.. is there any ways I can regain my happiness?\n\nThanks for your time :)",

If you enjoy the gym, focus on that and try to get back into  the hobbies you left. Look for something that you always wanted to try. Of course the lost job is an issue, can you go back to your original career?\n\nI was married to a woman that was all about herself and didn't ever care about anyone else's interest. She sucked the life out of me but i was too focused on her to see it at the time. When she decided to leave  my whole life seemed to just stop. I ended up in a hospital for 7 days for \"Stress\". They did help me understand that you can't be so focused on someone else and not take care of yourself. You are no good to anyone else if you are messed up. The gym and healthy lifestyle are a great start.\n\nOf course i'm just a random person on the network and have no clue about you other than what you posted. Find a way to have some fun.",

It's going to be hard, but you need to move on to someone that will give you the love and respect you deserve.\n\nI've also been in some dark places and know how hard it can be. Just focus on one small thing you can do today, and do it. It may be calling one place looking for an interview, work out for an hour, stop yourself from watching porn, or just getting out of bed even if you really don't want to. You might not do those things the next day or even mess up later that same day, but that's ok. It doesn't matter if you aren't perfect or super productive all day; just get that one thing done and freakin celebrate. Focus on the good you are doing to work towards a better self. Just getting on here and being so open about this shows your devotion to bettering yourself and shows you are really trying.\n\nI believe in you man. You got this.",

Take the name of Krishna or Jesus or Allah or any other form of God you follow. Be happy my friend, because the bad past will never return, the bad present will certainly end in future, and the bad future cannot last longer than death. So keep smiling my friend.",

If you concern about your privacy, then choose a P2P exchange (like Bisq) or find Bitcoin ATM near you.\n\nIf they accept XMR (monero), then it's even safer due to anonymous nature of this coin.\n\nYou won't buy XMR anywhere. You buy bitcoins and then convert BTC to XMR somewhere (there are many anonymous exchanges like Godex, SimpleSwap, etc)\n\nFor storing monero I recommend the official wallet: Monero GUI\n\nAlso many mobile wallets (Coinomi, Exodus) support both cryptocurrencies and allow to exchange them anonymously in third-party services.\n\nWhen you have bitcoins, monero or other crypto supported by market, then make an order and make payment.\n\nOne note about shipping. If you don't have any drop place (e.g. abandoned building), then the safest option is to order to your house. It won't make suspiction at shipping company. Otherwise they may open and check contents of the package.\n\nLearn also about controlled delivery. If asked to sign, it's safer to refuse so and deny that you ordered something from the sender.",

    "answerContent": "It depends on several factors.\n\nFirst of all, where in your life are you currently? College, graduated, working but no degree, single, married, with kids, good job, no job, savings to spend, living from paycheck to paycheck, so on.\n\nBecause that will lead your choices. It is far easier to relocate alone willing to accept any job and being an illegal immigrant for a while than run the whole legal and bureaucratic road to get a working permit or visa for you and a wife.\n\nAfter that, how much that will cost? Do you have the means? Do you need financing?\n\nThen, do you have any blocks? Legal problems on your home country? Language barrier?\n\nHow open to immigrants is the country you want to go to? How easy is to become part of the community? How to be accepted there?\n\nThis is the first assessment you need to do. You can find several resources online. Numbeo is the go to website to compare cost of living. There will be, in most cases, some kind of blog from people that migrated there, look for them. Also, for pricing purposes, try to find online classified and grocery sites for that country. It always provide a good idea on property, furniture, rent and food value.\n\nAnd the most important: plan a lot. Try to imagine the kind of problem that you may have and how you need to solve that problem. Consider absurd scenarios like war, pandemics, revolutions, riots, death (no matter if yours, significant other, kids, someone back home), accidents and what else comes to your mind.\n\nPlanning ahead will give you time and knowledge beforehand to react properly.\n\nAlso, consider that, eventually, it is better to stay where you are. No matter your situation, it will always be easier to solve your problems at your home country than trying to solve something being foreigner.",

  "question": "I have no Idea where to start, December 1-2020, My girlfriend left me for a guy and didn't even bothered to tell the reason behind it. Still I don't know. I changed my career and left my passion and hobbies just to take care of her and almost spent around 600 dollars per month just for the sake of her daily needs. Later I heard from one of my friends that she's been sleeping with a lot of dudes from her college when we were in a relationship. The day she left me is the same day I lost my dad. I couldn't even bring myself all together, Yet still I somehow managed to accept all of this and tried to bring back my life together. I started hitting the gym, had a healthy lifestyle and a clean work routine.\n\nLast month she texted me and asked me to take her back as her new boyfriend left her. Ever since she texted, I'm no longer focused of my goals and I'm always waiting for her text. I tried apply for 3 grad schools and got rejected from all of em and I also got fired from my job last week, even though it was my seniors mistake. I'm severely addicted to porn and I can't stop doing it. I try to work hard and keep myself positive all the time, Still I haven't been able to cross this rough path. I don't have any friends or family to advice me through this. I don't know what to do. I'm tired. I wanna go somewhere and never return. I just wanna be happy.. is there any ways I can regain my happiness?\n\nThanks for your time :)",

If you enjoy the gym, focus on that and try to get back into  the hobbies you left. Look for something that you always wanted to try. Of course the lost job is an issue, can you go back to your original career?\n\nI was married to a woman that was all about herself and didn't ever care about anyone else's interest. She sucked the life out of me but i was too focused on her to see it at the time. When she decided to leave  my whole life seemed to just stop. I ended up in a hospital for 7 days for \"Stress\". They did help me understand that you can't be so focused on someone else and not take care of yourself. You are no good to anyone else if you are messed up. The gym and healthy lifestyle are a great start.\n\nOf course i'm just a random person on the network and have no clue about you other than what you posted. Find a way to have some fun.",

It's going to be hard, but you need to move on to someone that will give you the love and respect you deserve.\n\nI've also been in some dark places and know how hard it can be. Just focus on one small thing you can do today, and do it. It may be calling one place looking for an interview, work out for an hour, stop yourself from watching porn, or just getting out of bed even if you really don't want to. You might not do those things the next day or even mess up later that same day, but that's ok. It doesn't matter if you aren't perfect or super productive all day; just get that one thing done and freakin celebrate. Focus on the good you are doing to work towards a better self. Just getting on here and being so open about this shows your devotion to bettering yourself and shows you are really trying.\n\nI believe in you man. You got this.",

Don't even worry of what will happen to you tomorrow or in future. The best way to feel happy is to accept what comes to you in life, it may be good or bad, but your attitude of accepting it, must be positive. Take the name of Krishna or Jesus or Allah or any other form of God you follow. Be happy my friend, because the bad past will never return, the bad present will certainly end in future, and the bad future cannot last longer than death. So keep smiling my friend.",

If you just want to go to the USA because people have money there, re-evaluate your priorities. Moving for economic growth is normal, but moving simply because you want to \"live with normal people who understand life and have money\" is kinda a bad idea. All that I'm saying is that this is a huge decision and you should have a really good reason for sacrificing so much for this.",

Because of this, he came up with the weirdest idea: spend some time making a deer trust us and then once it gets close enough and docile enough, kill it quietly so we don't startle other deer in the area (keeping their trust).\n\nSo he got dressed up in this shrub outfit, rubbed himself down in mud to mask his scent, and put some beef jerky around him on the floor. He did this for a few days, same time, same place, and same arangment of food and it looked like there was at least one regular visitor each day. On the 5th day (yes it took this long) he finally went for the kill (with a knife), but the thing that he didn't know about killing with a knife is that it's way harder than the movies. You have to let it bleed out a bit and really get a good placed stab in in order to down it. You also need to constrain it otherwise it will run away. Anyways, he didn't know any of this and I already gave up on him so he failed pretty bad. He got the knife in, but the deer kicked him pretty hard and got away, screaming and running really loudly.\n\nThat was the first and last time he went hunting with me XD",

It seems that russia is using way less power, resources, and strategy than they could be. From really stupid clumping of resources (easy air target), to just slow advances and low numbers, something seems off. It could be to perpetuate russian propoganda saying how bad ukraine is (war wasting lots of resources) and eventually justify using dramatic measures (nuke, more civilian targeting, etc). Or it could be an excuse for putin to exert some crazy \"emergency\" power over russians to \"stabalize the economy\". Idk if it will be as bad as hitler level control, but russia is already pretty totalitarian. So in either case it will have to go on for a bit more to strain resources enough to justify either or both actions.\n\nThese are all just posibilities though, and I'm just a crazy tin foil hat but you asked.",

It sounds like he has at least a couple other witnesses (although you can spread the word to more guys) and quite a bit of past things from her that are really solid and not disputable. Get a restraining order on her and be as close to your friend as you can to protect him if she comes again.\n\nI really value human life, so I will say that you do everything in your power to make sure it doesn't come to you guys killing her. At the very least, it would throw you guys in jail because you don't have a great cover for that; and yall don't want to go there. Even if she comes at him, I would try to really stay away from killing her. Taking a life (no matter how crazy) is never a fun thing and it really sits with you.\n\nKeep safe brother, I think you guys have a good case against her.",

Today, Man-In-The-Middle (\"MITM\") is basically ineffective, tutorials on this topic are either out of date of use contrived examples. What they show will not work on Facebook, Google,  Whatsapp etc, which is probably what your wife is using to communicate.\n\n2. Any evidence of \"cheating\" you obtain this way cannot be used in court because you obtained it illegally. Forget hacking and focus on practical legal issues with lawyers. Maybe get a PI to follow her to get the evidence you need, photos with another man in public are legal.",

But I don't know, it seems difficult to get there with a cardboard box so that no one sees it, I took a beaker there once, put it under my pants, put it in my backpack and went home when class was over\n\nDo you have any plans for me to at least see if it's possible? how would i do that to get everything i want + be unharmed?\n\n\n\nThe school is big, I would have to go down from high school, go down the stairs outside (which has a camera), and enter the cobblestone courtyard, but this can be done in the lap time of the break or a \"can I go to the bathroom?\"",

One possible way is if you can cut camera wire where all of them connects to server and security room. Then you must be isolated in a way so that no one can see you with eyes or you can put same in your bag and concel it somewhere where you chan collect it after school. Or better if you are trying to perform same during night. You go to your school with full face. Hand. Body and eye cover and unlocking mechanism like master keys. Blade and all. Now first of all cut wire as mentioned above break some extra locks and steel nothing in order to confuse them and head towards destination and steel stuff. I recomend choosing diffrent way out and complete pre research for exit. Now go to some anonamus place, i recomend burning your cloths and other things and head towards your home.",

    "answerContent": "WiFi jamming is easy, though modern WPA3 implementations largely avoid the issue. It's relatively new, so your school may still be on WPA2. TL;DR go download mdk3 on your laptop (aireplay-ng also works, but a little less straightforward. Good for targeted attacks). It has a mass deauth function, which blasts out a bunch of forged control frames that look like they're coming from the access point, telling the client to disconnect and reconnect. Get enough of them in a row, and the client will stay disconnected. Outside of WPA3, there is no easy mitigation for this kind of attack, though depending on how high budget your school's IT guys are, they may be able to physically locate you if you do this in 1 spot for too long",

Things don't work out for me in life. There were some things that brought pain, but it was not physical. I wanted to do some stuff, but lost motivation since it didn't work out.\n\nI was doing good in school but stopped because I didn't see other things change for me. I wanted to learn some skills to do something helpful in the world, but couldn't do it. Other people seem to be doing better. I can't figure out how to improve.\n\nI need guidance in life and feel lost. I can't earn the minimum pay and get into jobs. There is no desire to go after a job since it won't work and hasn't for a long time. I have lost money and been robbed, some online and one time when buying a car that didn't work. I don't want to talk about what I need help with specifically, but might so someone can understand.",

Example: Get weed for the low to sell it back at higher price to stoners (a zip of 28g for 80$ and sell the g for 10$ or 2.5g for 20$ example). Sell fake designer to people who wants designer but are too broke to buy the real thing so you make them think you're selling them real ones (you can make fake receipt (what i was doing)). Sell fake iphone (you can find some for 200$ and sell it for 1000$+).\n\nIf you want to make it a side hustle for a long term or even a short term and wanna keep it safe, you need to find someone who's gonna be in the front scene, sell it for you, and you become a plug now. You're now in the backstage so you're risking less but also earning less. After you make your hustle bigger.\n\nI used to legit give 20% to a girl to sell fake shoes for me because she was white and had a nice car so people would believe her more. Sometimes I was making 1k per week doing this. But sometimes I was doing 0$ in a month out of this jugg. My friend made 3k for selling 2 fake iphone 13 pro max because they're sealed so some people buy it as a gift and don't test it.\n\nNever had any problem, only when people are doubting, they don't buy but don't do shit. I only received some text of people telling me I've sold them fake and I just block them.\n\nIf you grow it big enough, you find a second person so you can find more customers for your product, etc etc.\n\nGood luck",

Utorrent is a P2P (peer-to-peer) communication software and it's used to connect directely to someone else and download some files from a \"someone else's\" computer. If someone look on that connection, you risk to be in a big trouble... You should use a good VPN for sure (not something inexpensive or free!).\n\nIn facts, don't use it!!!!\n\nDownloading from Dark Web (with tor browser) and a VPN is better. Tor (The Onion Router) use many relays before the server (It's a good thing) and the VPN fully encrypt the communication in/out of your computer (Another good thing!).\n\nIn conclusion... Download something from darkweb of clear net with Tor and a VPN.\n\nAdd: You should use a Linux Operating System. (A bit less virus)\nAdd: You should boot your Linux on a Bootable Live CD or Bootable Live USB Drive. (No risk for your data from hard drive if you don't have any!!)",

You and a friend will make a \"language\", first, you will tap the desk (lightly, so only both of you notice) the number of the question, question 1,, 1 tap, 2, two taps, 3, three taps... Then, you will put your hand holding your head with the number of the answer, if its A, one finger, B, two fingers, C three fingers, D, four fingers and E, the whole hand, make it look as of you are thinking and be really cautious not to get noticed. \n\n\n\nThey aren't much, but they really did help me, hope it works for you to !",

  "question": "I lost access to my old iCloud account a few years ago. My ex boyfriend got rid of my phone when he caught me talking to my sister. I was able to get into my iCloud account maybe 2-3 years ago.\n\nI’ve been trying for months to get into this account just to get the pictures off of it. My cousin just passed not to long ago we were close growing up and there’s pictures of him :(.\n\nI made this account probably 10-11 years ago when I thought I would never loose access to the account. So now 10 years and serval head injuries and a major car accident later, I have no idea what the heck I made the recovery information be. I feel like such an idiot!!\n\nI don’t know what the recovery email is just that it starts with an M.\n\nI have no clue the answers to the security questions are.\n\nI don’t have any device that the account will recognize.\n\nI do know what the phone number that was linked to the account is but I have no access too it anymore.\n\nThis is going to be impossible and I’ll probably never get into the account ever again. I’ve tried to apple they can’t help me.\n\nIf anyone has any suggestions or ideas on how to get in I would appreciate you forever    I",

What is she hidden.\n\nMake a plan to take her in a right mode and situation.\n\n15 years ago, I saw the interest of my mother was Disneyland Paris. (She was a fan of German fun parks, too).\n\nSo I spend her 3 days in the New York-Hotel in Disneyland Paris. I room for 4 only for her and me. Fun all day and a diner-show on her birthday. Many drinks like wine and long-drink. Oh, she was tired.\n\nThe bath-room had a tube. I prepared the bath with candles oil and parfum. Took water and bath-salt in.\n\n30 minutes later I went to the bath, she was sleeping. I woke her up and helped her to leave the tube. I saw her naked, her breasts, her black hair. I get hard.\n\nI help her with the towel. Touched her boobs, back and legs. And brought her to bed.\n\nIn bed I pressed my body to her body. Her back to my cock. My hands around her. searching her nipples. She sleep well. I did cum in my pants.\n\nI put off my clothes and washed me. When a went back to room, my mother was naked and hold her sleeping-dress in her hand and show me the sperm-wet-back of the dress.\n\nShe looked angry and told me to toke some hard drinks out of the minibar. She opened a bottle and drunk. Then another bottle. She smiled: \"Now I'm drunken and out of control.\"\n\nShe hold the dress with the sperm under her noise. \"Why have you started with out me?\"",

But unless you don't start trying, you won't be able to get out of it :) Start with lets say, fight someone whom you can start a conversation with, and slowly try befriending them. Join some social work center, or try to get into activities that your university performs. You'll slowly have to open up to the society thats around you in order for them to absorb you as one of them. You're what you make of yourself and there is no denying that at times life seems to not give you an option. But you'll have to try if you really want to change things around you. If you try really hard, in a matter of a month, you might atleast make a friend which is enough for a new start. Try out new things, places, maybe just be around people, or study hard and try interacting in class. You need to start somewhere so why not start looking for an opportunity thats popular and available around you.",

It doesn't have to be a timesink, there are a bunch of channels that make some really interesting content. VSauce doesn't post much anymore, but he has some very mentally stimulating content. SmarterEveryDay makes some really high quality, albeit infrequent, uploads. If you're interested in space like me, Scott Manley very frequently makes videos about space news. Same with Anton Petrov, though his are a lot more in-depth and specific. You may be surprised, watching stuff like that sparked a hobby of astrophotography for me, which is a fantastic conversation topic. You can learn a lot by just wandering around the internet, and using that knowledge will help you in real life",

    "answerContent": "In truth I am still young and I do not have that experience that the years give you but I do have some primary conclusions, I could tell you many phrases like \"never say never\" and a thousand more but in general it all comes down to never trusting in life , never trust anything, or anyone, never take anything for granted, finished or safe, always leaves a thread of possibility that the opposite happens, also as a point to say that being a good person does not guarantee a good life as well as work and effort are never rewarded and someone who works a lot in the end will always be below another socially, that without doing 10% than the other earns 10 times more, if they think to tell me that money does not matter I think they are wrong and I think that it does matter since everything is governed by money, they may think that money does not bring happiness (in my case it does) and to a certain extent it may be true there are people who live happily with what they have but that honestly depends like this The company was formed and today money says who you are and positions you in a place even if it doesn't correspond to you, because you have so much money, so much vouchers as a person, that's it. I know that I had said it as a point and that it was half of the comment but I have gone for another topic a little hahaha, in any case as a final conclusion and synthesis, \"money and distrust\"\n\nThanks for reading, I can only imagine in a few years that it will appear in philosophy books hahaha\n\n\"money and distrust\"- figueras7 (2022)\n\nIt would be funny, you know, but it's just a joke, I could add women or whores to the sentence, the second one, better said, I think it's better, but as I said, you have the whores with money, so you don't have to put them in. Thanks for reading again.\n\nthe fucking google translator of shit, I wanted to say bitch in whores, read it substituting it, don't prejudge me for it if by using google translator, I prefer to write and write in my native language it's easier for me",

    "answerContent": "Like another user stated, depends what you're trying to do. DDoSing WiFi is pretty straight forward (see mdk3 or aireplay-ng), but anything else you'll actually need ACCESS to the network. Getting access is maybe more straightforward than you'd think. WPA2 is the most common encryption standard right now, though WPA3 is new and solves a lot of the vulnerabilities I'm about to discuss.\n\nGo download your favorite Linux distro, Kali Linux will come pre-loaded with these tools. There are some programs like Wifite that try to automate this process, but there's a library of tools called aircrack-ng that will let you mess around with WiFi. The basic theory of cracking a WPA2 WiFi password is that if you record the packet transaction when an authorized client connects to the network, you can save the hashed password for the network (done with airodump-ng). Once you have that saved locally, you can start to brute force the password using a wordlist like rockyou.txt (comes with Kali) or Crackstation's list (downloadable online, much larger). This step is done with aircrack-ng. The technique isn't perfect, if the password is complex enough, it probably won't be in the wordlist. But if it is in the wordlist, aircrack-ng will stop and tell you when the password matches up with the hash.\n\nIn an absolutely ideal world, the wifi network you're trying to hack is WEP. This is almost certainly not the case, unless the access point is 15 years old and nobody has bothered to update it since. But there's a flaw in WEP's rng that allows an attacker to passively collect a bunch of data frames and reverse the rng to resolve the encryption key. On a sufficiently busy network, this process takes like 5 minutes, and can also be done with aircrack-ng",

    "answerContent": "hello, several things, the first asking this type of open and direct question will only make people think that you are a 13 year old rat who has learned to use tor for the first time, but well even if I told you to look at the questions too answered before asking why I think I answered this question on another occasion, finally I proceed to answer you and the truth is that I suppose you want your neighbor's wifi hahaha, just kidding, well I don't know what country you are from and this can vary between countries Since they can use some methods or others, I would tell you to check if the network is WEP (0.0001% possibility) but it will be compromised by looking at it, then if it has WPS activated, if it does, you could decrypt the password in a few seconds, there are many tools (investigate and you will discover) like for example reaver I think, you could also create no yes if it is well said captive portal or evil ap or evil twin I don't know how the hell it is said but with that you can create a false point replicating the name of the original and what be an open network at the same time you deny the service to the original and maybe your victim connects to your open network thinking that it is his and will ask for the credentials that will come to you, if you ask how the hell all this is done, there are tools they do it automatically, you just select the network and it automates it, it opens all the terminals in a pro plan and you get motivated, it's nice try it, I think wifite did this and airgeddon I think that too, last method that occurs to me would be to get the handshake (easy) and try to crack the hash with brute force there are tools to crack it but it is a method that requires hardware power, as well as a lot of time, it is slow and has a high failure rate because if I remember correctly it tries to crack a hash that its state cannot be inverted (decrypted) and return to the original but you take a passwd dictionary and try to pass a pass as a hash and compare it like this all the time until they come out the same for what you pass s of the dictionary is the wifi pass (brute force of all life but faster as it is a hash), that's why I tell you that if you do it you will need a good dictionary and inform yourself of the model and company and try to find a dictionary with filtered passwords of that company or similar since people do not usually change the password of the router by default, taking advantage of this you can try since there are leaks on the internet of how the passwords of each router are generated based on their network name (ssid) or they are filtered the one by default, good luck.",

Having more options between lethal and hand to hand combat is great and will save your butt, although you should always carry lethal force.\n\nIdk how to find criminals though, so good luck on that.\n\nYou should totally watch police body cam or security cam footage (both all over youtube) of this kinda stuff before you get out on the streets.\n\nStay safe brother.",

But unless you don't start trying, you won't be able to get out of it :) Start with lets say, fight someone whom you can start a conversation with, and slowly try befriending them. Join some social work center, or try to get into activities that your university performs. You'll slowly have to open up to the society thats around you in order for them to absorb you as one of them. You're what you make of yourself and there is no denying that at times life seems to not give you an option. But you'll have to try if you really want to change things around you. If you try really hard, in a matter of a month, you might atleast make a friend which is enough for a new start. Try out new things, places, maybe just be around people, or study hard and try interacting in class. You need to start somewhere so why not start looking for an opportunity thats popular and available around you.",

It doesn't have to be a timesink, there are a bunch of channels that make some really interesting content. VSauce doesn't post much anymore, but he has some very mentally stimulating content. SmarterEveryDay makes some really high quality, albeit infrequent, uploads. If you're interested in space like me, Scott Manley very frequently makes videos about space news. Same with Anton Petrov, though his are a lot more in-depth and specific. You may be surprised, watching stuff like that sparked a hobby of astrophotography for me, which is a fantastic conversation topic. You can learn a lot by just wandering around the internet, and using that knowledge will help you in real life",

    "answerContent": "In truth I am still young and I do not have that experience that the years give you but I do have some primary conclusions, I could tell you many phrases like \"never say never\" and a thousand more but in general it all comes down to never trusting in life , never trust anything, or anyone, never take anything for granted, finished or safe, always leaves a thread of possibility that the opposite happens, also as a point to say that being a good person does not guarantee a good life as well as work and effort are never rewarded and someone who works a lot in the end will always be below another socially, that without doing 10% than the other earns 10 times more, if they think to tell me that money does not matter I think they are wrong and I think that it does matter since everything is governed by money, they may think that money does not bring happiness (in my case it does) and to a certain extent it may be true there are people who live happily with what they have but that honestly depends like this The company was formed and today money says who you are and positions you in a place even if it doesn't correspond to you, because you have so much money, so much vouchers as a person, that's it. I know that I had said it as a point and that it was half of the comment but I have gone for another topic a little hahaha, in any case as a final conclusion and synthesis, \"money and distrust\"\n\nThanks for reading, I can only imagine in a few years that it will appear in philosophy books hahaha\n\n\"money and distrust\"- figueras7 (2022)\n\nIt would be funny, you know, but it's just a joke, I could add women or whores to the sentence, the second one, better said, I think it's better, but as I said, you have the whores with money, so you don't have to put them in. Thanks for reading again.\n\nthe fucking google translator of shit, I wanted to say bitch in whores, read it substituting it, don't prejudge me for it if by using google translator, I prefer to write and write in my native language it's easier for me",

There is no knowledge that can explain happiness, no formula, no code, no cheats.\n\nMostly people will say money, love, house, drugs, parties...\n\nFor me, happiness is having nobody. Being alone but not feeling like you are alone. Sitting in dark with peace in your mind, not fighting while you are thinking, but talking to yourself in some day. So my answer is inner peace. Once you got that, you'll be able to learn anything, earn unlimited money, just everything.",

Besides, I would not only spend it, I would make it grow and rise.",

Creating drawings and art is not easy for me, but I want to learn how to make unique anime art.\n\nAlso a place where the drawings can be shared on the dark web.  Somewhere with experts where I can get some ideas or help for the drawings. I am just not sure how to use a computer to make this kind of art.",

    "answerContent": "Look into graphic design and art classes around you if you want. If you wanna DIY it, pull up YouTube, Pinterest, whatever the hell you want and find a couple references. Start practicing basic anatomy and the generic anime artstyle to start, and when you get a hang of that then you can start building on your own style. If you don't want to do it on paper, I'll suggest a couple of free (and not free) illustrator apps:\n\n- Medibang Paint (Free, PC) : Works pretty well, a bit complicated but easy to figure out\n\n- Sketchbook (Free, PC/Mobile) : Basic sketch/drawing app. One of my favorites still tbh\n\n- Sketchable (Free, PC) : Open canvas drawing app, similar to Sketchbook\n\n- Ibis Paint or whatever its called (Mobile) : Very good app, many brushes and tools\n\n- Krita (Free, PC) : Similar to Clip Studio but free version, complicated but useful\n\n- Adobe Illustrator (Buy, PC) : Fucking expensive but good app besides being from Adobe\n\n- Clip Studio Paint (Buy, PC) : Also expensive as hell but used by most comic creators. Lots of tools plus an animation creator thing, plus a marketplace w/ free things made by other users. Fantastic app just hellishly expensive\n\n\n\nWith digital art you can use a mouse (hard as fuck imo tho), buy a touchscreen laptop, or buy a drawing tablet plus stylus to just plug into your computer. Take your time learning, make it fun, fuck around and find yourself a style you like",

So, you won't see nothing like those things I said above in here.\n\nI can share with u some websites with knowledge and things like that, but I'm advertising you: do not search for selling/buying shit in darknet.\n\n\n\nONLINE LIBRARIES\nZLibrary- http://zlibrary24tuxziyiyfr7zd46ytefdqbqd2axkmxm4o5374ptpc52fad.onion\nZLibrary- http://loginzlib2vrak5zzpcocc3ouizykn6k5qecgj2tzlnab5wcbqhembyd.onion/\nJustAnotherlibrary- http://libraryfyuybp7oyidyya3ah5xvwgyx6weauoini7zyz555litmmumad.onion/\nImperial Library- http://kx5thpx2olielkihfyo4jgjqfb7zx7wxr3sd4xzt26ochei4m6f7tayd.onion/\nLibrary Genesis- https://libgen.gs\nLa renacida bibl. - http://papyrefb3jewa7fdbakdomx2pj576w7u25fk3kjk6gyyuofz5awcu4id.onion\nComic Book Library- http://nv3x2jozywh63fkohn5mwp2d73vasusjixn3im3ueof52fmbjsigw6ad.onion\nTor guide- http://guideeedvgbpkthetphncab5aqj7dp5t74y7vxsoonnvmaeamq74vuqd.onion/\nMarxists- http://marxists3va6eopxoeiegih3iyex2zg3tmace7afbxjqlabmranzjjad.onion\n\nBLOGS\nTor Blog- http://pzhdfe7jraknpj2qgu5cz2u3i4deuyfwmonvzu5i3nyw4t4bmg7o5pad.onion/\nParaíso Niilista- http://niilismo.net/\nMath404- http://2prjomqqohz2hshnx7nirh4oisia7hedvnlif2hj5ehy3jmlsznogtad.onion/blog/\nMayVaneDay- http://meynethaffeecapsvfphrcnfrx44w2nskgls2juwitibvqctk2plvhqd.onion/\n0ut3r Space- http://reycdxyc24gf7jrnwutzdn3smmweizedy7uojsa7ols6sflwu25ijoyd.onion/\nVDare- http://f2vfjp3jc37gxgn4hum4uf2bhi2w3kp4jbzdwegrn6bvtezbhminobid.onion/\nDig Deeper- http://digdeep4orxw6psc33yxa2dgmuycj74zi6334xhxjlgppw6odvkzkiad.onion/\nTheYosh- http://theyoshxgvcjm4s2xdt6zcjym4kgskibrlos6fai26yes4bhpia5z7qd.onion/\nMemoirs of a Holocough Survivor- http://potatoynwcg34xyodol6p6hvi5e4xelxdeowsl5t2daxywepub32y7yd.onion/\nFlashlight 2.0- http://ovgl57qc3a5abwqgdhdtssvmydr6f6mjz6ey23thwy63pmbxqmi45iid.onion/\nBeneath VT- http://bvten5svsltfpxrxl72ukqxixwo2m5ek5svmcxgrmkta4tbmiemuibid.onion/\n\nSEARCH ENGINES\nDuckDuckGo- https://duckduckgogg42xjoc72x3sjasowoarfbgcmvfimaftt6twagswzczad.onion/\nPhobos- http://phobosxilamwcg75xt22id7aywkzol6q6rfl2flipcqoc4e4ahima5id.onion/\nTorch- http://xmh57jrknzkhv6y3ls3ubitzfqnkrwxhopf5aygthi7d6rplyvk3noyd.onion/\nAhmia - http://juhanurmihxlp77nkq76byazcldy2hlmovfu2epvl5ankdibsot4csyd.onion/\nExcavator- http://2fd6cemt4gmccflhm6imvdfvli3nf7zn6rfrwpsy7uhxrgbypvwf5fad.onion/\nHaystak- http://haystak5njsmn2hqkewecpaxetahtwhsbsa64jom2k22z5afxhnpxfid.onion/\nTordex- http://tordexu73joywapk2txdr54jed4imqledpcvcuf75qsas2gwdgksvnyd.onion/\nDeep search- http://search7tdrcvri22rieiwgi5g46qnwsesvnubqav2xakhezv4hjzkkad.onion/\nTor66- http://tor66sewebgixwhcqfnp5inzp5x5uohhdy3kvtnyfxc2e5mxiuh34iid.onion/\nSearx- http://z5vawdol25vrmorm4yydmohsd4u6rdoj2sylvoi3e3nqvxkvpqul7bqd.onion/\nOnionLand Search- http://3bbad7fauom4d6sgppalyqddsqbf5u5p56b5k5uk2zxsy3d6ey2jobad.onion/\n\nDIRECTORIES\nHiddenwiki- http://hiddenwep33eg4w225lcdwcez4iefacwpiia6cwg7pfmcz4hvijzbgid.onion/\nThe Hidden Wiki- http://6nhmgdpnyoljh5uzr5kwlatx2u3diou4ldeommfxjz3wkhalzgjqxzqd.onion\nHidden Wiki FRESH- http://wikiw2godl6vm5amb4sij47rwynnrmqenwddykzt3fwpbx6p34sgb7yd.onion/\nOnionLinks- http://jaz45aabn5vkemy4jkg4mi4syheisqn2wn2n4fsuitpccdackjwxplad.onion/\nOnionLinks- http://s4k4ceiapwwgcm3mkb6e4diqecpo7kvdnfr5gg7sph7jjppqkvwwqtyd.onion/\nTorlinks- http://torlinksge6enmcyyuxjpjkoouw4oorgdgeo7ftnq3zodj7g2zxi3kyd.onion/\nDeep links Dump- http://deepqelxz6iddqi5obzla2bbwh5ssyqqobxin27uzkr624wtubhto3ad.onion/\nDeep link- http://deeeepv4bfndyatwkdzeciebqcwwlvgqa6mofdtsvwpon4elfut7lfqd.onion/Cat/4\nDarkDir- http://l7vh56hxm3t4tzy75nxzducszppgi45fyx2wy6chujxb2rhy7o5r62ad.onion/\nTasty Onions- http://22tojepqmpah32fkeuurutki7o5bmb45uhmgzdg4l2tk34fkdafgt7id.onion/\nDarknet Home- http://catalogpwwlccc5nyp3m3xng6pdx3rdcknul57x6raxwf4enpw3nymqd.onion/\nThe safe onion links- http://safeonu4c4xme2kzhuaer4ucm7enrjv23oznzwkz4d4f2wm7cc4ucuid.onion/\nBester Elektriker- https://www.darkweblist.com/directory/categories/email-and-messaging",

I've heard of cases like these happen with people that actively engage with \"demonic\" or \"evil\" acts, at least that is what they name such acts to be. They consider it a \"demon\". An example of this possible theory is that, there is an actor which shouldn't be named, which engages into \"demonic\" acts often, \"child abuse\", \"drugs\", \"rituals\", and other such acts. \"Drugs\" can have an impact on your brain and cause you to see/hear things that shouldn't be there. While engaging into anything \"satanic\" or \"demonic\" potentially might cause such thing to occur. My personal advice is to stay away from potential \"demonic acts\" for now. If that isn't the case, \"drug overdoses\" can potentially cause it too. Hope this helped! Stay safe friend.",

If it is a small amount of goods, how can it be shipped safely and cheaply? Maybe if I do some work manually, the costs can be lower.\n\nAs an example, getting some oil from another country and transporting it to where I want it to go. I need to know ways to not use gas while transporting goods while using an efficient method. Since a company is not responsible for making some arrangements, it can get more expensive to get certain items. Some information on acquiring certain resources would be helpful",

  "question": "I pray all y'all are in peace right now.\n\nHidden Answers is a huge community from Deep Web. Since 2015 or before this community can walk with its own legs, and is a wonderful place to get references, knowledge and many stuff about many contents.\n\nBut since this site was dropped by its last owner, we didn't have an good version of Hidden Answers. Someone telled me about a Hidden Answers with CP tolerated, and it's very fucking hateful, because the purpose of this website isn't share this type of shit content for sick people.\n\nAll the other shit that people in darknet are searching for, like another porn content or \"kill videos\" are tolerable here, but CP is personal offense to victims of this virus.\n\n—\n\nWe're back, we have rules, we have huge persons behind of staff team and we're a new team, english exclusive, with no one in the staff with another native language (I won't tell you our countries because we would lose our anonymity). The last owners of this domain are no more linked with this website.\n\nAnd we will made Hidden Answers the great place it was before, without bots in users and without shit content like CP.",

    "answerContent": "it actually is easy. Easier than it sounds. You just need to have some money to invest into it (to buy new phone number, and to not owe dealers for their stuff) and also first you need few friends that use weed. If you give them more weed at start, for example they pay for 3g and you give them 4g, they will keep buying even more amounts than they did. Also they will bring friends. Parties are good idea but for parties you will need few people with you to protect you, to bring people to you and etc. Also keep in mind some people just randomly might beat you and take your stuff away from you, so you will always need coworkers that will share profit and that are really really loyal to you.\n\nWeapon is actually mostly needed, but avoid to use it unless you are really dying.\n\nI wish you luck, and don't let everyone know you got weed, don't bring huge amounts with you outside, don't stash it in your own apartment and always be paranoid. Police can be on every corner and any moment they can jump in your apartment or search you outside while you got stuff on yourself. Make a plan how to avoid being searched and hiding weed outside",

If you're trying to sell this weed for teenagers at good schools (\"rich people schools\"), you would probably get success with your selling plan.\n\nOtherwise, if you're trying to sell this thing for people in university, who've between 17 years old and 21 years old, they already took cannabis before, so they won't be so dumb to buy a finished joint, because the seller (no in your case) can put oregano inside of it and sell this as full-weed joint. They can detect this shit from squares away.\n\nSo you should sell the weed and weed silk, or I don't know, just sell it for who wants, it's clear enough.\n\nIsn't a profitable and dangerous thing sell weed in universities, because this shit is legal in most of states in US and every fucking student can have access to it, so...\n\nYou don't need guns (just take a knife with you if you are scared about fights and things like this) and you don't need much people. Just sell your thing, offer this shit for some people with simple dialogs:\n\n\"What's up bro, I'm high as fuck and I have some shit I get from my cousin (whoever you want to be your \"dealer\") and I'm selling some weed, if you want to I will make for you $XX,XX dollars the gram\" — begin from it if you're a completely retard in social dialogs.",

  "title": "Someone scammed me on reddit please help",
  "question": "please do not ask me why or judge me on this: \nI exchanged some nude pictures of women (all legal) with a total stranger on reddit by phone. He sent me some pictures of his \"wife\" and i sent him some pictures of a woman i know, lets call her sara. But sara doesnt know that i got her nude pictures. Furhtermore I never talked to sara or have her contact info whatsoever. So after we exchanged the pictures I noticed that he is deleting the pictures he sent an i realized he was scamming me the whole time. According to what he said he lives about 150kilometres from me (of course i did not tell my location, just the state).\n\nHere comes the crazy part: He then told me the first name of sara and it could not be possible for him to know this but he did. Even if someone had my phone in his own hands to look at the nudes of sara he would not find a trace or any connection to her or to her phone etc. I dont have saras phone number or any contact info or chat with her\nHe said that he recognized her from somewhere (like he knows her in person). \nIt is possible that he could identify her just by her picture?\n\n i did the following; i reportet his reddit account, blocked him, deleted my reddit account and changed the password of the email adress to which my reddit account was linked. then i changend my ip adress several times\n\nWhat can i do to further protect myself? He now has the pictures and I dont know what to do",

To make it into a public and private internet, ARPANET's founders split it into 2 internets. The ARPANET would evolve into the modern clear net, while another version, MILNET would evolve into the deep web. The Deep Web was initially meant for bypassing government censorship, but evolved into what we now know today. Tor browser evolved into the main gateway for the Deep Web.",

I honestly couldnt fall for some of this stuff.\n\nits weird because some of these sites seem like they havent been used in a long time then you hear in the past of websites exit scamming with 20 million dollars in crypto. How do people honestly even find the sites in the first place? \n\nif i seen one I would think it was inactive and no need to message them, how can you make an actual business known and aware to a lot of people?\n\nalso Does daniels hosting still exist?",

  "title": "if everything is a scam on the darkweb, how do real markets even succeed?",
  "question": "all i ever hear on here is dont bother buying from this vendor or that website its all a scam.if everyone knows it s a scam how are these people making money? are people really buying from these places or taking chances to get scammed that bad? are they that desperate? do people really fall for these scams? I honestly couldnt fall for some of this stuff.\n\nits weird because some of these sites seem like they havent been used in a long time then you hear in the past of websites exit scamming with 20 million dollars in crypto. How do people honestly even find the sites in the first place? \n\nif i seen one I would think it was inactive and no need to message them, how can you make an actual business known and aware to a lot of people?\n\nalso Does daniels hosting still exist?",

  "title": "How much does Joule withstand Gletcher CLT B25 when adding gunpowder/sulfur from matches?",
  "question": "In fact, the question is not only about the mentioned revolver, but in general about all revolvers of a similar structure. There are many videos on the Internet how people use bullets like Quintor Phantom to turn such revolvers into an impromptu Flobert. But with what power can such a weapon safely shoot if you add a little more gunpowder?This gives me rest: on the one hand, these pistols are made of cheap alloys, they are not even steel. On the other hand, people make weapons on 3D printers under 22LR literally of plastic. I ask the engineers (and just people who have experience) to look at the device of such pneumatics and estimate with what force this weapon can shoot in order to shoot at least a dozen shots before breaking. Thank you very much in advance.",

  "title": "How much does Joule withstand Gletcher CLT B25 when adding gunpowder/sulfur from matches?",
  "question": "In fact, the question is not only about the mentioned revolver, but in general about all revolvers of a similar structure. There are many videos on the Internet how people use bullets like Quintor Phantom to turn such revolvers into an impromptu Flobert. But with what power can such a weapon safely shoot if you add a little more gunpowder?This gives me rest: on the one hand, these pistols are made of cheap alloys, they are not even steel. On the other hand, people make weapons on 3D printers under 22LR literally of plastic. I ask the engineers (and just people who have experience) to look at the device of such pneumatics and estimate with what force this weapon can shoot in order to shoot at least a dozen shots before breaking. Thank you very much in advance.",

Also you will find your best match in your local area in your community only like if you are a jue and some narxi cult lets you in, I dont think it will be a pleasent experence for you. So become active in your local community and keep searching for people like you and join a cult through them so that they can trust you and you can deticate yourself to cult propperly.\nAlso a pro tip from my side\nIn cults, not all people agree with your openions but some will. So join that group there in order to better interact with people like you and explore cultism propperly.",

I have heard of configuring NGINX and using it as a web server for your website but I dont think this is the best idea via tails. I dont want a remote vps with debian installed I just feel its too risky. The site does not need a backend. Anyone know any other ones out there not listed on ahmia or torch? I find it hard to find anything. about the same as daniels hosting, freedom, etc. \n\n\nAnyone got any suggestions on what to do?",

  "title": "Any experts here on how to steal phones?",
  "question": "Ok so quick emotional backstory. I have old, crappy phone from like 2015 and that thing is barely holding together. The screen is on the verge of shattering into a million pieces from another drop and the camera is always blurry and going out of focus. The thing is in its last moments of life and I'm a cheap fuck who doesn't wanna spend $1000+ dollars on a new phone. Also I'm barely keeping the lights on so yea, no option for buying a used phone either. Anyways, onto the actual question. Is there anyone here that is experienced in stealing phones? Preferably someone who steals them sneakily rather than a grab-n-run type of situation. iPhones aren't my preference because good luck getting past activation lock, so androids are my primary target since I've gotten into them before. Anyone got some tips like where people are more likely to have their phones outside their pocket (like on a table in an outdoor bar or on the pool, etc). Ways of actually taking the phone without the owners realizing for a couple of seconds. (I just need enough time to get to my bike and take off). I'm been thinking of jerry-rigging some \"equipment\" like double sided tape on the end of a long pool or a long trash picker to snatch the phone with. Any advice you have would be very helpful. Thx",

Or something which lead you towards your goal like studies, job, working towards goal or anything similar which gives you satisfaction from within rather then some kind of stimulation. \nEven if she accept you or whether she is your gf, give her part of time and work for your goals and life, in this way, you will get simulation as well as long term happiness from your goals. Also fact that a person need to talk to other people of both gender and establish every kind of connection with them in order to survive will terminate your jelessy. As at the end of the day she is yours and there is no need to ne over posessive to her regarding her bros and friends even male friends. \nIf she reject you, you should not be jeless as she was never made for you and you deserve someone better.",

  "question": "Im looking to bring justice and make a person pay for his evil past..\n\nMy idea is to sneak a wine into his terrace and add poison to the wine. Ideally poison I can make myself\n\nI dont want him to die, I want him to have his life totally fucked by eg getting EXTREME permanent headache, tinnitus, blindness or ANYTHING really that cause permanent damage that will ruin his life.\n\nIt could be anything else, like causing a severe pain or him unable to move his body again. Anything that fucks his health for life\n\nThe effect ideally has to come after a long time so he wont be able to tell where it comes from\n\nDo you have any ideas? I have also considered adding huge amount of LSD that would be fun xD but he would be able to tell where it comes from which will increase risk..",

  "question": "Ok so a little backstory. Around in Jun 2022 I found an iPhone 13 pro max on the curb. I obviously took it and went into a hidden place and popped out the SIM card to stop it from beeping (the owner activated lost mode). I put the SIM card into my burner android and read the number on it, then I did a reverse phone number search and I found out who it belonged to. Long story short, I found the owners' address and Facebook account. Turns out it belongs to a teenage kid. I tried different passcode attempts but I got permanently locked out. So I reset the phone and now it's stuck in activation lock. My friend who used to live across from the kid had some info about the kid on his phone. I know this because I went through his phone when he was asleep and I found the kid's AppleID email. All I need now is the kid's password. I know his Snapchat and I have him added on my alt account. But the kid is the only one living in that house that doesn't gave any social media besides Snapchat (as far as I know). I searched his name on every social media I could think of and I found nothing. His mom, dad, and sibling all have at least two social media accounts. Just not him. Remember, I already have the *****@icloud.com address. I just need the password and I'll be in his phone.\n\nI know some things about this kid, such as the exact date he was born, what school he used to go to, and his personal phone number (as well as other phone number belonging to various members of this family). I also have his sibling's TikTok and Instagram, as well as his mom's Facebook and his dad's Facebook, Snapchat, Tiktok, and Instagram. I know that both of his parents used to work in the military (not gonna say which branch for my own sake). I know a LOT about this family but not too much about the kid. I have a whole document written about this family on my old iPhone in the notepad. I keep track of everything I can and I stalk all their accounts every couple days.\n\nSo does anyone here have any ideas on how to finess this kid out of his password? My friend said I should talk to him, which is possible since I have him added on Snapchat, but I don't want to risk him telling his parents and them either changing the password or trying to find out where I live. Any advice would be very helpful. Until then, I'll continue stalking all accounts belonging to this family and maybe I'll even consider stalking the kid in real life to find out more about him.",

Apart from this, if these both are not case, it may be somewhat related to your desires, fear, dark side, future prediction ability or something like that so you can see someone spiritual, as experienced and real spiritual guys can cure psycological disorders better and easy. But, another fact I would like to spacify is if you wish to visit someone spiritual, visit real spiritual guys not fake ones. Also, this answer was just added to widen your perspective of knowing and curing problem. I dont say that its something like that but I just want to widen your perspective.",

I only know that it's (the qr code) connected to your DigiD or ID card or something so you can't hack the app to generate codes, you need to hack the GGD servers (where the stuff is located). At least this is what I think, but is there a way without doing that (and also by not getting a medic to sneakily get my friend into the system)? Thanks already!",

You just need to change details on your own certificate to your friend's once. Change number and paste any random qr there (ss you yourself can stay out of trouble) and save/print fake certificate. It will give your friend entries, and he can even submit it where documents are not thoroughly checked which I think happens almost everywhere. But, documents are checked, he will be in great trouble. \nAnother method is convince a doctor not to insert injection into your friend and go to him for vaccination. In this case, you can do anything with certificate.",

  "title": "I have a big problem with my parents, what should I do?",
  "question": "Before I ask my question, I need to set the context.\n\nOn Wednesday, I spent a very good part of the day, at the end of the morning of classes at the college, a supervisor I'm friends with drove me and my crush (person you have romantic feelings for) downtown in his car (then went home).\n\nFrom noon to 2pm we stayed in town and ate at Five Guys.\n\nThe origin of this outing was group work, therefore we went to her place. At her place we laid in bed, started by relaxing and watching Breaking Bad, and also vaped.\n\nDuring this time, I received many calls and messages from my parents, as I seem to have told them that I would be home around 4pm.\n\nAfter a few hours, we started the group work, which consisted of making a video, therefore we wrote the text with ChatGPT and we still had to record the video.\n\nAfter several different takes that were messed up, I got a call from my dad, which I decided to answer, still with my crush next to it.\n\nOn the phone, my dad yelled at me like I had done something really stupid. I was supposed to take the bus home after work, but he considered that the time was so traditional that he had to go look for me. I have to say that I didn't tell him I was at a girl's house, my family is very religious and they consider it a sin. I had said that I was at a male friend's house, living much further away than my crush's house, the latter only lives 5 minutes walk from my house. He decided to pick me up at the false address of my so-called male friend where I was staying.\n\nAfter this call, I was very anxious and stressed. I didn't laugh once during the shooting of the video.\n\nOnce the group work was over, I went home, vaping on the way back.\n\nTo get home faster, I ran, which caused me to be slightly out of breath.\n\nWhen I got to the front of my house, I texted my dad that I had arrived home. He had already arrived at the wrong address I had given him.\n\nI felt even more anxious and stressed as I walked through the door of my house. Once I arrived home, around 7pm (but my parents consider this time very late) my mother was waiting for me.\n\nI went up to my room to wait for the meal to be ready.\n\nI have to say that in town I bought an iPhone, but my parents don't want me to have a phone (simplified context).\n\nI was in a big hurry to unpack it and set it up, but after a few minutes, I heard my mom coming up the stairs. I immediately scrambled to hide my iPhone under my pillow. My mom opened the door to my room, and I think that's what got me into trouble.\n\nI stood in front of my bed, as if I had something to hide, I don't remember if my posture really showed if I wanted to hide something.\n\nAnyway, once my dad got home, I was eating. He quickly yelled at me but said very little and went to watch TV.\n\nOnce the meal was over, I went back to my room to finish setting up my iPhone.\n\n\n\nToday was Sunday, in the late afternoon, my parents proposed me to go and eat something for four o'clock; in reality it was a real ambush.\n\nWe went to Germany, because we live near the German border, to eat in a « cofee and cake ».\n\nWe ordered and sat down at the table, after a while I started not to be hungry anymore so I decided to go to the bathroom.\n\nWhen I come back to the table, my mother starts talking to me about how bad this week was, and decides to tell me about what happened on Wednesday.\n\nI think she really prepared her speech, because it was neat, clear and concise.\n\nShe starts with a short introduction with no real disturbing phrases. Then she moves on to what I would call \"offensive.\" She starts by telling me that when I came home Wednesday night I was very pale and different, and that the next day, Thursday, I was still very pale and had huge dark circles.\n\n\n\nWhy I was pale and different: because I was very anxious and stressed, and certainly because of a nicotine shot\n\nThe next day: because I didn't sleep much, I was busy configuring and testing my iPhone\n\nShe told me, I quote \"that she suspected me to have made an experiment\" and \"that sometimes when you are young you want to test something\" only implied sentences of this kind.\n\nMy mother has a Lechere antenna (Google definition: https://www.google.com/search?q=lecher+antenna+definition). Basically she asks a question in her head, and the antenna answers with \"yes\" or \"no\" by tilting or not.\n\nShe probably asked a question like \"did my son do something weird on Wednesday\" or \"did my son smoke cannabis\" or \"did my son go to a seance\" or \"did my son do something he has never done before\".\n\nI have never smoked or used cannabis, let alone gone into spiritualism.\n\nMy mother is very vicious and paranoid.\n\n\n\nWhy did I make these assumptions?\n\n\n\nMy father had already found puffs (disposable electronic cigarettes) in my room a few months ago and had pointed them out to me in a very subtle way. He had put a felt pen in the bag that contained the puffs (there had never been a felt pen in that bag before, which made me notice that someone had been there).\n\nA week ago, I got an offer from a friend on the internet to be a cannabis courier, basically I just have to receive packages at home and give them to him. I would have been paid 200€.\n\n\n\nAs this is impossible at home, I asked my crush, who has much less strict parents. She still refused after I told her what was in the packages.\n\nOnly she told one of her friends. He threatened to tell my parents and the principal if I didn't give him a puff. I never gave in because I know he has no proof.\n\nMaybe he looked up my parents' number on Facebook or in the phone book and informed my parents.\n\n\n\nWhat do you think I should do?\n\nThank you for your answers and for reading everything.",

Its just so perfact that it just fits and locks in correct spot. Not only show but you have to become like that. Only do this if you are comfertable with it. As love is once in a lofetime relationship. You van do it for casual and manupilative pourpos too but it will harm you both maybe not equal but both. Choice is yours.\nBut if your goal is to crack a deal or do some kinda business or something related to professional field, you have to show them you are as usefull to them like lichin where alge and fungus stay together for mutual benefits where alge provide fungus food and fungus provide alge protection none of them can survive alone. You have to show them and build your relationship like that.\nIf you want to threten your enemy to that extinct, you have to show him he is messing with wrong force like a rock messing with dinamite or a bird messing with sun. You both dont have any competition and he should not just live but die on your mercy and his biggest and last mistake was to mess with you. You have to threten him to such an extnlinct.

If you think it's important to be better than most people (for status or something) it's a a lot dumber to do that you will have even less status. Dying also means everything that you wanted to do can't happen anymore, for what? Only because some or most people are better than you? That's just disappointing and also maybe it looks people are better than you, but these days you can find the best of the best a lot easier just by having the internet. The point is not to be better than people, just be you, don't strafe towards perfection, be happy, maybe make other people happy (maybe even by just being happy) and that's how you can do something for the world if you want that. Being happy is a choice, no one can withhold you from that. If you don't want something just say no. Do the things you like, it doesn't have to cost any money, you can even look for friends or a girlfriend/boyfriend. It would be a bummer to lose you from this world only because you think you're not good enough",

Their definations are as follows as they will help you better recover or react if you face rejection.\nGirl Friend: She is one who is comited to you and she also feels same or similar as you feel for her. You may want to impress her in order to make her agree on marriage or sex or she is upset on you for something.\nCrush: She is one you like. It does not necesarly mean she also likes you back. She may or may not. So probability of rejection is high in this case. Things like one sided love and all work in this case.\nIf she is your GF as you said in question or even ex, you must know much about her, if not, what the hell were you guys doing all the time?\nIf she is your crush, as dudu2050 said, try to follow her and seek information about her also check compatibility too that whether she is right for you or she is just a round ass and you guys are going to have hard times in future. And same for her too that you are suitable for her or not. If she fits you, try to impress her with something that excites her with an equal probability of rejection.\nIf she rejects or any compatibility issue occurs. make sure to step back and try forget her.",

Yes, initially no one likes them or pays attention to them but as soon as they begin to follow their dream and passion, they begin to gain respect from others and people who challenged them gets to shame on themselves they just burn themselves in jelousey. But, In order to make that happen you have to be daring to take risk to walk on your chosen path without getting upset from failiuers as they are part of success but you have to keep walking in order to find that real joy and find your happiness in your work and passion what you are doing with your complete will, heart, soul and brain.\nOne such example is Elon Musk If you want to read something like that, read about him, or what he wrote. You can also listen to same if reading bores you.",

Are you sure that the people in the house are Muslims? :) Other than that, I don't understand how Muslims cause you discomfort regarding their religion. A Muslim cannot pressure anyone about religion. This is expressly prohibited in the Qur'an. In verse 109:6 of the Qur'an: \"Your religion is for you, my religion is for me.\" says. Also, in verse 2:256 of the Quran, it says: \"there is no pressure in religion\". So no Muslim can force you to become a Muslim. They cannot pressure you because of your faith. Apart from that, we can help if you can write clearly about the main issue that is bothering you.",

However, after experimenting with psychedelics, mostly LSD and shrooms, I now believe that there is some sort of hidden energy or something much larger and incomprehensible than what can be perceived by a human. Essentially my question is, for anyone else who's done psychedelics or anyone experienced in the supernatural, do you think powerful drugs such as LSD and DMT are a link to \"God\" or these larger than life energetic sensations and hallucinations. And if so, why is it hidden from us in normal day-to-day life?",

Some people believe that cryptocurrencies have the potential to revolutionize the financial industry, while others view them as risky investments.\nIt's important to do your own research and make informed decisions before investing in any asset, including cryptocurrencies. As with any investment, there are risks involved and it's possible to lose money.\nIn terms of mining, it is possible to mine certain cryptocurrencies using specialized hardware. However, mining can be complex and may require a significant investment in equipment and electricity.\nUltimately, whether or not you choose to trust or invest in cryptocurrencies is a personal decision that depends on your individual circumstances and risk tolerance.",

Then economy will need something which is limited like crypto. They only have certain numbers that can be mined and in this way, they will be future gold.\nBut it does not mean at all that you should start investing/mining any crypto but rather you should go for something to trust like bitcoin/etherium/monero. They will never go zero but other random crypto has more chances of getting zero then going to sky.",

You can search for the website where the video was originally hosted and see if it was archived before it was deleted.\nSearch for mirrors or copies: Sometimes people will create copies or mirrors of videos and post them elsewhere on the internet. You can try searching for the video title or keywords related to the video on search engines or social media platforms to see if any copies or mirrors exist.\nContact the uploader or website owner: If you know who uploaded the video or the website where it was hosted, you can try contacting them to see if they have a backup or if they can provide you with a copy of the video.\nUse specialized software: There are some specialized software tools that can help you recover deleted videos. However, these tools may not always be reliable or legal, so use them at your own risk.\nIt's important to note that even if you find a copy of a deleted video, sharing or distributing copyrighted material without permission is illegal and could result in legal consequences.",

    "answerContent": "Freedom of expression is a fundamental human right and is enshrined in many international human rights documents, such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. However, the question of whether freedom of expression should be unrestricted or not is a complex issue that requires careful consideration.\nOn the one hand, some argue that unrestricted freedom of expression is necessary for a truly democratic society, where all ideas and opinions can be freely expressed and debated without fear of censorship or reprisal. They believe that restrictions on free speech, even if well-intentioned, can lead to a slippery slope where any speech that is deemed controversial or offensive can be suppressed, leading to a chilling effect on free expression.\nOn the other hand, others argue that there are limits to free speech, particularly when it comes to hate speech, incitement to violence, and speech that threatens national security. They believe that such speech can be harmful and can lead to real-world consequences, such as discrimination, violence, and instability.\nUltimately, the balance between freedom of expression and restrictions on speech will depend on the specific cultural, social, and political context in which it is being applied. In many cases, laws and regulations may be needed to strike a balance between protecting free speech and preventing harm to individuals and society as a whole.",

However, it's important to remember that everyone's struggles and experiences are unique, and we can't always compare them directly.\nIf you are feeling suicidal, it's important to seek help immediately. You may be struggling with a mental health issue or other factors that are contributing to your feelings, and there are many resources available to help you. Please reach out to a mental health professional, a crisis hotline, or a trusted friend or family member for support.\nIt's also important to remember that suicide is not a solution to your problems, and that there is always hope for a better future. While it may seem like there is no way out of your current situation, there are people who care about you and want to help you find a way forward. You are not alone, and there is help available if you reach out for it.",

You can follow traders who have a proven track record of successful trades and use their signals to make your own trades.\n   2.Technical analysis tools: There are many technical analysis tools available that can help you identify potential crypto trading opportunities.

  "question": "My life in Uzbekistan has been a living nightmare. I am constantly subjected to the oppressive rule of my parents and sister, who are Muslims and atheists respectively. They do not wish me well; instead, they want me to live by their laws which I cannot accept as it goes against my own beliefs. As a result, I feel scared and trapped in this hostile environment that has ruined my life - something that is further compounded by the fact that all members of this family lack understanding on topics such as freedom or politics.\n\nI am writing to beg for help in saving myself from this situation so one day soon enough, I can be free again without having someone constantly look after me. My mental health suffers from the constant fear of being judged or punished if I don't follow their rules - something that becomes increasingly unbearable over time as it affects every aspect of my life including work and socializing with other people outside our home. Without any external support or assistance available at hand, what hope do i have?\n\nIt is clear then why seeking help is absolutely essential for me right now so please consider lending your aid towards helping save an innocent soul from its current suffering! With your generous contribution even just a little bit could mean more than you know: A chance at reclaiming back control over one's own destiny once more-something we all take for granted but rarely appreciate until faced with situations like these ourselves.. Thank you kindly!",

    "answerContent": "In simple terms, money laundering is a form of financial crime that enables criminals to disguise the source of their money. The result is that 'dirty' money appears 'clean' - an outcome that can frustrate the efforts of law enforcement agencies to bring criminals to justice.\nAs we'll go onto explain, money laundering entails accumulating money from criminal activity, mixing it in with funds that were earned legitimately, and then filtering it back to its original source. This means that criminals can effectively 'cash out' laundered money without risking getting caught.\nIn many cases, laundered money is also used to finance the continued operation of criminal organisations. The practice is linked to a whole host of illegal activities, including:\nGeneral fraud\nDrug trafficking\nTheft and embezzlement\nTax and customs violations\nTerrorist financing\n\nFor criminals, masking the source of ill-gotten gains is important since the alternative is to keep large amounts of cash. Money laundering also makes it far more difficult for the authorities to successfully prosecute criminals and seize back dirty money under the Proceeds of Crime Act.\nWhat businesses are used for money laundering?\nMoney laundering schemes are complex and often have a cross-border element. In truth, all businesses are at risk of financial crimes since criminals are often inventive and are constantly finding new ways to dodge the provisions of money laundering legislation.\nWhen it comes to money laundering, some of the most at-risk organisations include major financial institutions, casinos, firms involved in the financial services industry, and any company dealing with sizeable cash transactions.\nHow do money laundering schemes work?\nCriminal organisations go to great lengths to disguise both the source and destination of criminally derived funds. As a result, the ways in which they launder money are constantly changing and it can be difficult for countries and businesses to keep up with the relevant legislation as it tries to keep pace with existing and emerging financial crimes.\nDespite this, money laundering stages is generally thought to be carried out over three key phases: placement, layering, and integration. All typically involve suspicious activities - but that doesn't mean they're easy to spot.\nStage 1: Placement\nThe placement money laundering stage involves placing 'dirty' money into existing financial systems. Criminal money is moved away from the illegal activities from which it was sourced, making it appear as if it came from a legitimate source.\nThis might involve placing the funds in an offshore bank account, and is also known as 'washing' illegally acquired money.\nStage 2: Layering\nThe layering money laundering stage entails muddling laundered money through a legitimate financial system. Criminals enter into a complicated web of financial transactions to further complicate the trail that leads back to their illicit activity.\nBy layering money through numerous transactions and bank accounts, criminals can obscure the source of their funds and may even resort to fraudulent accounting practices to do so. Criminal proceeds may be staked at a casino or via another form of gambling, before being used to purchase securities and other assets, and then going on to be used to purchase financial products. In some cases, criminal gangs may even shuffle money through various different currencies - moving large sums of cash on an international level.\nStage 3: Integration\nIn the third stage of integration money laundering, criminals integrate their funds into the economy. This involves extracting the money from the complex transactions of the layering stage, and using it to make large-scale investments.\nSince by now the funds appear to come from legitimate sources, it becomes possible for criminals to spend their money without raising the alarm about suspected money laundering. Often, laundered money is used to purchase property, shares, and luxury assets that make criminal money seem even more legitimate.\nExamples of money laundering schemes\nWith a better understanding of how money laundering works in theory, firms can start to look out for signs of suspicious activity. There are a number of well-known money laundering schemes out there, and while money launderers are always looking for new ways to conduct criminal activities without getting caught, many of the schemes they use have similar features.\nHow criminals 'place' money into the financial system\nThere are countless ways for money to enter the financial system, but there are some more common ways in which criminals approach the placement stage of money laundering.\nBlending of funds\nThis involves blending criminal finances with the takings of a legitimate business. Money launderers generally use cash-based businesses such as car washes, betting shops, bars, and tanning salons to syphon criminal funds into the market. The term money laundering actually stems from the fact that criminals historically used laundrettes to mask the proceeds of crime.\n'Smurfing'\n'Smurfing' is the practice of splitting a large amount of money down into smaller transactions. In doing so, criminals can make their activities seem less suspicious and prevent their transactions from crossing the reporting threshold set by anti-money laundering legislation.\nIllegal funds are typically deposited into one or more bank accounts by various people (known as 'smurfs') over an extended period of time. The practice makes it seems as if the money has come from genuine legal activity, and is much harder for banks to spot than huge cash deposits.\nInvoice fraud\nInvoice fraud is the practice of using a business to over or under bill for goods or services. On a basic level, it involves over-invoicing or under-invoicing or providing false descriptions of goods. Phantom shipping is another well-known form of invoice fraud that involves creating documents for orders that are never actually shipped. This practice allows for criminal gangs to transfer money gained from illegal activities to foreign countries.\nOffshore accounts\nCriminals frequently use offshore accounts to avoid the gaze of international law enforcement agencies and the financial action task force. It can be very hard for official bodies to identify the true beneficial owners of offshore and overseas bank accounts, making it very difficult to track money laundering.\nCarrying small sums of cash abroad\nAnother means of laundering dirty money is to carry it overseas and to pay it into a foreign bank account. To do this, money launderers typically carry small sums over international borders in order to avoid having to make a customs declaration.\nAborted transactions\nTo move money into a legitimate financial system, some criminal organisations transfer money to a lawyer, an accountant, or a financial institution. The funds are paid into a client account in expectation of a major transaction, which is subsequently cancelled. Criminals can then request the repayment of their money, making the funds seem as if they came from a legitimate source.\nHow 'layering' conceals the proceeds of crime\nLayering is arguably the most complex stage of the money laundering process, as criminals attempt to create a confusing web of transactions and transfers. This might involve converting money into other forms of international currency, investing in shell companies that appear legitimate, putting money into real estate projects, or purchasing stocks and other assets.\nMoving money across borders electronically\nIt's much harder to trace the origins of money when it's moved across international borders. Firms should generally be on the lookout for money that has moved through multiple jurisdictions before being spent in the United Kingdom. The involvement of currency exchanges and international banks can further complicate anti-money laundering processes, and so businesses need to carefully scrutinise any payments that have a cross-border element.\nConverting funds into financial instruments\nBy investing in stocks and other securities, it's possible for criminals to effectively disguise the source of their illegal funds. While many financial institutions and banks that provide investment services are on the lookout for any criminal activity, it's much harder to trace money back to its source once it has been invested in the markets.\nInvesting in companies with a functional front\nShell companies and even functional businesses can be used to disguise the real origins of laundered cash. These are often small enterprises that frequently take cash payments, and so it becomes very difficult to sort illicit capital from physical money that has been earned by offering a legitimate product or service.\nHow 'integration' disguises the source of funds\nOnce so-called 'dirty' money has been cleaned, it can be integrated into existing financial structures. In many cases, criminals use laundered money to invest in luxury products such as cars, jewellery, and artwork. They also make investments in the property market, and may even go as far as to create further fake invoices to overstate the value of the goods they import or export.\nInvesting in assets\nOnce a criminal has disguised the origins of cash generated from fraudulent and illegal activities, they often start to invest in order to create legitimate streams of income. It's worth noting that the money generated from these investments is sometimes used to finance future criminal endeavours, and so the cycle may very well continue.\nRaising false invoices\nBy over-estimating the value of goods imported or exported from a country, criminals can further obscure the source of laundered money. They might purchase new assets with 'clean' money before using them to integrate and layer further illegal gains throughout the market.",

  "question": "The Rubber Ducky USB tool device is a type of hardware device that is used in computer security testing and penetration testing. It is a small USB flash drive that looks like a harmless storage device but is actually a powerful tool for executing scripts and automated commands on a computer system.  The Rubber Ducky is typically programmed with a specific script that contains a series of keystrokes and commands to be executed on the target system. When the device is plugged into the USB port of a target computer, it emulates a keyboard and sends the pre-programmed keystrokes to the computer, which can be used to execute various commands, such as opening applications, downloading and installing software, and even taking screenshots.  This device is often used by security researchers and IT professionals to test the security of computer systems and networks. However, it can also be used for malicious purposes, such as stealing sensitive information or installing malware on a system. As such, it is important to use the Rubber Ducky tool responsibly and only for authorized security testing purposes.",

  "question": "You can make RDX with this simple method, with the exception of the ammonium nitrate. All necessary precautions should be taken to prevent injury or death. Below I’ll list the equipment and materials you’ll need to make RDX.\n\nEquipment needed to Make RDX : -\n\n\n\n500 ml beaker \n\nGlass stirring rod\n\nFunnel and filter paper\n\nIce bath container\n\nThermometer\n\nBlue litmus paper\n\nProtective Eyewear (DeWalt)\n\nProtective Suit\n\nFace Mask\n\nMaterials need to make RDX: -\n\n\n\nHexamine (can substitute with Methenamine)    \n\nConcentrated Nitric Acid    \n\nDistilled Water    \n\nTable Salt  \n\n  Ice  \n\nAmmonium Nitrate\n\nHow to Make RDX\n\n1.Place beaker in ice bath and carefully pour 550 ml of concentrated nitric acid into beaker.    \n\n2.When acid cools to 20 degrees below centigrade, add small (pea sized)amounts of crushed hexamine tablets into the beaker.    \n\n3.The temperature will rise after adding the hexamine; continue to slowly stir the mixture with your glass stirring rod.    \n\n4.Do not let the mixture go above 30 degree centigrade or you’re fucked. Add ammonium nitrate to the liquid bath to cool it down faster.    \n\n5.Add more ice and salt into the ice bath to bring the temperature of the mixture to below 0 degrees centigrade. Maintain the temperature for twenty minutes (set timer)    \n\n6.Pour mixture into a liter of crushed ice, shake and stir mixture like a martini.    \n\n7.Allow the mixture to melt, once melted use your funnel and filter paper to extract the crystals while disposing of the corrosive liquid left over.    \n\n8.Bring a half liter of distilled water to a steady boil and add the crystals.    \n\n9.Immediately filter the crystals out again and test with blue litmus paper (you want it to stay blue), repeat steps 8 \u0026 9 and the blue litmus paper stays blue.  \n\n10.Allow RDX crystals to be thoroughly dried before storage.",

I would say psychologically it totally depends on the strength of a person mind to live this lifestyle, but eventually all minds can break with the right amount of pressure.",

  "question": "I have a generation older female relative (not related by blood, related by marriage ) we never really talk talk so we don't really have a familial relationship. But I find her extremely attractive and she is kinda attractive and she's also a strong independent woman who speaks her mind. From sometimes I've been coping a feel when I'm around her touching and grabbing her (I have slowly made my way to grabbing) it has gotten to a point where she knows what I'm doing, she dodges me if people are around, and if I manage to grab her and hold on for some time she removes my hand. But she has never said a word about it and she is a kind of woman who would have said something if she didn't approve, it is not like I have any power over her that she cant say anything. I don't want to do anything non consensual, I don't pursue her if she dodges, and I always make sure that she's aware  to hat I'm approaching her, when she removes my hand I don't put it back on. This whole dynamic turns me on. I want to know should I keep things as it is, turn it up a bit or stop.",

  "question": "Scientism or scienticism is the intellectual tendency or philosophical concept of a positivist nature that asserts the superiority of science over all other forms of human understanding of reality (religion, philosophy, metaphysics, etc.), as it is the only one capable of presenting practical benefits and achieving authentic cognitive rigor. Thus, it advocates for the use of the scientific method, as applied in the natural sciences, in all areas of knowledge (philosophy, human sciences, arts, etc.).\n\nI believe that science is the best way that humanity has to understand nature. For me, morality and ethics should be seen as obstacles to progress. Where can I find a scientistic society on the Deepweb?",

Find when did this happen EXACTLY and why did it happen by going back through your string of thoughts.\nKeep in mind, the human brain always finds ways to disguise the truth to make a person feel that they are right and not wrong = bypassing the problem instead of solving it and furthermore creating a more complex problem.\nThe more effort you take into this the more you will notice a pattern or a loophole in your life. \nTip: Find an escape",

Does Marijuanna and Pscyh meds cause complications?  Ive been to so many insititutions already..  My mom is at her witts end with me already.  What do I do.  I went to the hood to get soft but got hard instead cuz I couldn't find soft. Normally I always would get soft yet I don't plan on doing that again.  What is the answer?  I feel like I only want to be half sober.",

I have lost the respect and trust of my parents and family for a \"funny joke\". \nEventually this alongside other complex events all connected to this shit got me mentally disordered with a D.I.D with an alter almost completely opposite of who naturally I am , I see it as a blessing and a curse at the same time.\nThe lessons that I learned are: To ALWAYS pay attention about every fuckin detail in my surrounding, talk very less and just listen and observe more. I process every sentence I am bout to say before saying it. I always make sure people understand who the fuck I am, and make sure they do not try to fuck around with a person whose mind broke and had to re-discover who he is all over again.

  "title": "How can I setup a Rasperry Pi to get inlimited free internet from a Coxwifi hotspot?",
  "question": "My mom turned off our internet years ago and I was stuck without it for a couple months until I realized there was a Coxwifi hotspot near my house. I installed a command line that lets me spoof my MAC address on my Macbook, and then I would use their free trial for an hour. Every time they disconnect me I change my MAC address and use the free trial over and over again. I even wrote an Applescript program that does everything for me, including auto-filling the captive portal that pops up. All I have to do is open the script and not 30 seconds later I'm connected again. But getting disconnected is extremely annoying, especially when I'm playing Roblox. I'll be chilling in the game and suddenly it disconnects. I have a Raspberry Pi running Kali Linux so here's what I was thinking about doing, and I want to know if this will work:\n\nSet up my Raspberry Pi with three Wifi adapters.\n\nTwo adapters will connect to the hotspot, and the third one will give wifi to my laptop. Basically make the Pi a sort of Wifi repeater\n\nI will write a script that disconnects one of the wifi adapters from the hotspot, changes its MAC address, and then reconnects. 30 minutes later, the other Wifi adapter will do the same. That way there's always a constant internet connection to my laptop. I can learn how to script a program that will automate all of this, so that's not the problem. The problem here is how do I make this work in terms of the Wifi? Like if I have two Wifi adapters connected to the same Wifi network, how does Kali handle this? Does it split Wifi traffic over both adapters or do I have to tell it which one to use? Remember, the Wifi adapter has to switch the internet traffic to the other adapter before disconnecting itself or I'll lose internet connection. How can I make this work?",

Of course, I understand that the real purpose of the donation is to support privacy and not to receive a gift, but I'm just curious. Thanks in advance for any insights!",

The best thing you can do is just keep living. I promise you that everything will get better eventually. You just need to give it enough time and you need to put in the effort to make your life better. Pls at the very least try to rethink this. There will always be a better option than suicide. Even if everything seems hopeless now and it feels like there is nobody there for you the only thing you can do is be there for yourself. As long as you got yourself you can get through any emotion your brain tries throwing at you. It will take time but it will be worth it. And with everything else in life the feelings that are making you think this way will pass. You will get better,  you will find new people,  you will have love and friendship,  and most importantly you will have happiness. Just wait it out, you will prevail from this battle and if it means anything I will be hoping the best for you.",

    "answerContent": "evilnicegirl taught about all basic stuff but first of all, change your name if it is abhay in real life and use a mailbox from altaddress (can be easily found using excavator and find excavator link on tor.link) or protonmail (prefer onion one).\nKeep visiting hidden answers as this is your best place to get your desired knowledge from people like dudu2050 and share if you have some with newbies like theevilnicegirl lol.\nAlso there are several sites to explore out of which many are scam but several are genuine illegal stuff but scams are more. So I recomend you to use only well known and trusted sites like silk road, red rooms etc., you may also try some new stuff too but at your risk only. Also ask for a good site right hear as this community is very helpful and kind until and unless you don`t ask any childish question. Also if you get scammed by any site do report it hear as this is biggest and most active community on dark web where people are helping each other for free so DO REPORT in order to protect others and punish scammers by reducing their possible victims. \nAlso if you find a genuine business do report it too as it will help him grow and expand which will build a stronger community and help tohers cause if you will help others, others will help you. This is how things work.\nAlso if dudu2050 and theevilnicegirl are reading this, please help me with my question guys as we are a few super active guys in hear. So if you know anything, answer my question regarding importing illegal stuff.\nBtw. you asked for red room link, i searched it but for now, it seems down but keep searching it as popular services reoccur in hear. But in mean time, this may help but I don`t know for sure if it is 100% real or not.\nhttp://p7r64hlfp6gofx6j6amcar4xpgfddkso6qkraciqsxasfkcu6c2dnzad.onion",

You have to believe in things when they are not happening that they will happen some day and things you are practicing are totally worth and real not waste of time. Physical things are those which you see first and then believe but these are spiritual things which can only be seen if you believe. Then after a lot of practice and efforts you will be able to do some small things and see some small changes definately not as you expect but yes I am warning you this path is long and difficult and results are not same as movies. They are very low as compare to them. In order to get same results as movies you will have to spend your whole life behind this thing only. Even leaving your family and society and living in forests.",

Also in case of a scam of finding a good genuine service, you should report hear on hidden answers as this is hub for dark web knowledge and it will help others finding genuine services and staying away from scammers which will build a strong community.\nBy the way, which service scammed you so that we do not feed them unknowingly.",

It is odorless, colorless, and has a slightly bitter taste.\nAlso Knowing As “ACID”\n1) Grind up 150 grams of Morning Glory seeds or baby Hawaiian wood rose seeds.\n2) In 130 cc. of petroleum ether, soak the seeds for two days.\n3) Filter the solution through a tight screen.\n4) Throw away the liquid, and allow the seed mush to dry.\n5) For two days allow the mush to soak in 110 cc. of wood alcohol.\n6) Filter the solution again, saving the liquid and labeling it “1.”\n7) Resoak the mush in 110 cc. of wood alcohol for two days.\n8) Filter and throw away the mush.\n9) Add the liquid from the second soak to the solution labeled “1.”\n10) Pour the liquid into a cookie tray and allow it to evaporate.\n11) When all of the liquid has evaporated, a yellow gum remains. This should be scraped up and put into capsules.\n30 grams of Morning Glory seeds = 1 trip\n15 Hawaiian wood rose seeds = 1 trip\nWrote By Ross",

  "question": "Let's say I have a certain amount of money (not very large), please tell me how can I use it to earn money? I know it sounds a little infantile and naive, but I am interested in this topic and I would be ready to devote time to it. About me: I am fond of programming, studying to be a doctor, but now I took a vacation for health reasons, so there is a lot of time. Thank you!)",
